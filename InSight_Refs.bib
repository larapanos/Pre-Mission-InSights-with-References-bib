abstract = {The most prominent feature on the surface of Mars is the near-hemispheric dichotomy between the southern highlands and northern lowlands. The root of this dichotomy is a change in crustal thickness along an apparently irregular boundary, which can be traced around the planet, except where it is presumably buried beneath the Tharsis volcanic rise. The isostatic compensation of these distinct provinces and the ancient population of impact craters buried beneath the young lowlands surface suggest that the dichotomy is one of the most ancient features on the planet. However, the origin of this dichotomy has remained uncertain, with little evidence to distinguish between the suggested causes: a giant impact or mantle convection/overturn. Here we use the gravity and topography of Mars to constrain the location of the dichotomy boundary beneath Tharsis, taking advantage of the different modes of compensation for Tharsis and the dichotomy to separate their effects. We find that the dichotomy boundary along its entire path around the planet is accurately fitted by an ellipse measuring approximately 10,600 by 8,500 km, centred at 67 degrees N, 208 degrees E. We suggest that the elliptical nature of the crustal dichotomy is most simply explained by a giant impact, representing the largest such structure thus far identified in the Solar System.},

@article{Arvidson,
abstract = {[1] Hematite-bearing deposits in the Terra Meridiani region of Mars constitute the top stratum of a partially eroded layered complex that covers dissected Noachian-aged cratered terrain. The hematite unit consists of dark plains and dunes covering a bright substrate. This substrate is fully exposed beyond the borders of the hematite-bearing deposit and consists of polygonal ground separated by ridges or valleys, together with layered deposits that have been eroded into a variety of landforms. The complex is partially covered by a regional-scale aeolian mantle that thickens toward the north. The hematite-bearing stratum exhibits low albedoes, pulse widths, and intermediate thermal inertias, whereas the underlying unit exhibits high values of these parameters. Both units have spectral emissivity signatures similar to those for the low albedo cratered terrain to the south, with the addition of hematite for the top stratum. The complex is interpreted to consist of extensive plains-forming lava flows and tephra deposits emplaced during an extensional regime and at least partially buried by an aeolian mantle. Aeolian stripping of the mantle exposed much of the complex and differentially eroded the deposits to produce the landforms existent today. Exploration of the hematite-bearing deposits by the 2003 Mars Exploration Rover, ''Opportunity,'' will allow testing of the hypotheses presented since this stratum has been locally reworked into dunes that only partially cover the underlying brighter portion of the complex. In particular, the rover-based measurements will allow us to test the extent to which the unusual remote-sensing properties of the units indicate aqueous alteration.},

abstract = {The stresses which must be maintained on faults bounding the rift topography at Tempe Fossae—the “North Tempe Rift” (NTR)—and Valles Marineris (VM) on Mars are estimated, using a simple elastic model and topographic data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). The absence of rift-flank uplift at the NTR is consistent with an elastic thickness, Te, of 20 km or greater at the time of rift formation. The maximum resolved shear stresses on bounding faults due to this topography do not therefore exceed 20 MPa, similar to the inferred strength of terrestrial faults. Elastic thickness estimates at VM are mostly around 50 km or greater. Therefore, for canyon widths of ∼400 km, the bounding faults of VM, if present, must be able to withstand stresses of up to approximately 100 MPa. However, if the fault-controlled sections of the canyons do not exceed 150 km in width, as suggested by geomorphological analysis, the fault strength required is only 20 MPa. Although the maximum resolved shear stresses required to support the topography at VM may need to be greater than the stresses which terrestrial faults can support, at least some faults on Mars are no stronger than similar features on Earth. This observation is consistent with the existence of liquid water in the shallow subsurface of Mars at the time the faults were active. On Venus, plate tectonics is probably prevented by the frictional resistance to motion across strong faults. On Mars, it is more likely that the large thickness of the elastic layer of the lithosphere and the possible positive buoyancy of the crust are responsible for the observed lack of plate tectonics.},

abstract = {The density profile of an SNC model Martian interior is calculated from the results of previous experimental work that determined the modal mineralogy of the model mantle up to Martian core-mantle boundary pressures. The moment-of-inertia factor of Mars is calculated as a function of core composition and crustal thickness using the SNC model mantle density profile as a constraint. Two sets of calculations are performed. In the first, the bulk composition of the planet is not constrained to a C1 chondrite composition. Assuming a Martian crust density of 2.7–3.0 g/cm3, a crust thickness of 25–150 km, and the core composition proposed by Dreibus and W{\"{a}}nke, Fe 14 wt{\%} S, the calculated moment-of-inertia factor ranges from 0.367 to 0.357. These models include a perovskite-bearing zone in the Martian interior. Considering core compositions ranging from pure Fe to pure FeS changes the moment-of-inertia factor by only ±0.001, but at higher S abundances, core size increases, such that the depth of the core-mantle boundary is shallower than the depth of perovskite stability. In the second set of calculations, the bulk composition of the planet is constrained to a C1 composition requiring a crust thickness of 180–320 km, assuming a crust density of 2.7–3.0 g/cm3. The calculated moment-of-inertia factor is 0.354 and a perovskite-bearing layer is absent from the Martian interior. As it is unlikely that the thickness of the Martian crust is greater than 100 km, the bulk composition of Mars cannot be constrained to a C1 chondrite composition as proposed by the Dreibus and W{\"{a}}nke model (G. Dreibus, H. W{\"{a}}nke, Meteoritics 20 (1985) 367–382). In order to determine if the Martian mantle is more iron-rich than the Earth's mantle, we may need not only an improved estimate of the moment-of-inertia factor of Mars, but also tighter constraints on Martian crust thickness and density. The absolute degree of iron-enrichment, however, cannot be specified without also knowing the size of the Martian core. A moment-of-inertia factor of less than 0.342 is not geochemically feasible, because it requires that the mantle of Mars contains no iron.},

Their results point to relatively late growth of Tharsis, at about the same time as the valley networks were created, which suggests a causal link between volcanic outgassing and the stability of superficial liquid water.},

The procedures by which the spectra are processed to yield quantitative concentrations are described in detail. The concentrations of elements determined over the locations of the various Mars landers generally agree well with the lander values except for Fe, although the mean of the GRS Fe data agrees well with that of Martian meteorites. The water-equivalent concentration of hydrogen by mass varies from about 1.5{\%} to 7.5{\%} (by mass) with the most enriched areas being near Apollinaris Patera and Arabia Terra. Cl shows a distribution similar to H over the surface except that the Cl content over Medusae Fossae is much greater than elsewhere. The map of Fe shows enrichment in the northern lowlands versus the southern highlands. Silicon shows only very modest variation over the surface with mass fractions ranging from 19{\%} to 22{\%} over most of the planet, though a significant depletion in Si is noted in a region west of Tharsis Montes and Olympus Mons where the Si content is as low as 18{\%}. K and Th show a very similar pattern with depletions associated with young volcanic deposits and enrichments associated with the TES Surface Type-2 material. It is noted that there appears to be no evidence of significant globally distributed thick dust deposits of uniform composition.},

abstract = {The rheology of the Martian mantle and the planet's initial temperature is constrained with thermal evolution models that include crust growth and test the conditions for magnetic field generation in the core. As observations we use the present-day average crustal thickness of 50–120km as estimated from the Mars Global Surveyor gravity and topography data, the evidence for the crust being produced mostly early, with a rate declining from the Noachian to the Hesperian, and the evidence for an early magnetic field that likely existed for less than a billion years. We use the fact that the rate of crust growth is a function of temperature, which must be above the solidus in the sub-lithosphere mantle, and the mantle convection speed because the latter determines the rate at which melt can be replenished. The convection speed is a strong function of viscosity which, in turn, is a strong function of temperature and also of the water content of the mantle. We use a viscosity parameterization with a reference viscosity evaluated at 1600K the value of which can be characteristic of either a dry or a wet mantle. We further consider the Fe–FeS phase diagram for the core and compare the core liquidus estimated for a sulphur content of 14{\%} as suggested by the SNC meteorite compositions with the core temperatures calculated for our cooling models. Two data sets of the Fe–FeS eutectic temperature have been used that differ by about 200K [B{\"{o}}hler, R., 1996. Fe–FeS eutectic temperatures at 620kbar. Phys. Earth Planet. Inter. 96, 181–186; Fei, Y., Bertka, C.M., Finger, L.W., 1997. High-pressure iron–sulphur compound, Fe3S2, and melting relations in the Fe–FeS system. Science 275, 1621–1623] at Martian core–mantle boundary pressure and in the eutectic composition by 5wt{\%}. The differences in eutectic temperature and composition translate into a difference of about 400K in liquidus temperature for 14wt{\%}sulphur. We find it premature to rule out specific mantle rheologies on the basis of the presently available crustal thickness and crust growth evidence. Rather a trade-off exists between the initial mantle temperature and the reference viscosity. Both a wet mantle rheology with a reference viscosity less than 1020Pas and a dry mantle rheology with a reference viscosity of 1021Pas or more can be acceptable if initial mantle temperatures between roughly 1700 and 2000K are allowed. To explain the magnetic field history, the differences in liquidus temperatures matter. For a liquidus temperature of about 1900K at the Martian core–mantle boundary as calculated from the B{\"{o}}hler et al. eutectic, a dry mantle rheology can best explain the lack of a present-day dynamo. For a liquidus temperature of about 1500K at the core–mantle boundary as calculated from the Fei et al. eutectic all models are consistent with the observed lack of dynamo action. The reason lies with the fact that at 14wt{\%}S the Martian core would be close to the eutectic composition if the Fei et al. data are correct. As inner core growth is unlikely for an almost eutectic core, the early field would have been generated by a thermally driven dynamo. Together with the measured strength of the Martian crustal magnetization this would prove the feasibility of a strong thermally driven dynamo.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of mantle convection in Mars, using an axisymmetric spherical-shell model, show partial layering caused by the two exothermic olivine-spinel ($\alpha$-$\beta$, $\beta$-$\gamma$) phase transitions. An extended Boussinesq approximation has been used in which viscous dissipation, adiabatic heating and cooling, and latent heat are included. The Rayleigh number (Ra) has been varied between 5 × 105 and 108. The partial layering with the vertical velocity at the exothermic phase transitions varying strongly in space and time is the result of two opposing effects: the enhanced buoyancy of the phase boundaries by thermal anomalies and the impeding influences from the latent heat release (or consumption). The effect of the latent heat is stronger in Mars than the Earth because of the comparatively low pressure gradient in the Martian mantle and the smaller excess temperature of upwellings and downwellings. The time-series of the mean vertical mass transport across the phase transitions show oscillations between blocking and acceleration of the flow. The amplitude and the oscillations in the time-series increase with increasingRa. Because of the partial layering, the planet will cool more slowly and less uniformly than suggested by thermal evolution models with parameterized convection. In addition, the number of strong mantle plumes is reduced to only a few upwellings. Such a pattern is suggested for Mars by the existence of two pronounced volcanic centers, Tharsis and Elysium. This could also cause a strong time dependence in the Martian volcanic activity. The latent heat release causes the mantle temperature to increase across each transition by about 50 K and produces a hot lower mantle and a liquid core. We have tested the case of a 85–350 km thick perovskite layer at the core-mantle boundary. A layer thicker than about 300 km would convect separately, and induce leaking to the mantle above at a significantly smaller rate compared to the layers induced by the olivine-spinel phase boundaries. For a perovskite layer smaller than about 300 km, the convective vigor near the core-mantle boundary decreases with the layer thickness.},

abstract = {Minimising the launch mass is an important aspect of exploration mission planning. In-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) can improve this by reducing the amount of terrestrial materials needed for planetary exploration activities. We report on a recently concluded investigation into the requirements and available technologies for creating hardware on extra-terrestrial bodies, using the limited resources available on site. A trade-off of ISRU technologies for hardware manufacturing was conducted. A new additive manufacturing process suitable for fabricating structures on the Moon or Mars was developed. The process uses planetary regolith as the base material and concentrated phosphoric acid as the liquid binder. Mixing the reagents creates a sticky construction paste that slowly solidifies into a hard, rock-like material. Prior to solidification, the paste is extruded in layers, creating the desired structures in a 3D printing process. We used Martian regolith simulant JSC-Mars-1A, but the process is not selective towards regolith composition. Samples were exposed to thermal cycles and were mechanically characterised. Reduced-scale demonstrator structures were printed to demonstrate structure fabrication using the developed process.},

abstract = {The circum-Hellas area of Mars borders Hellas Planitia, a giant impact ∼4.0–4.2Ga old making the deepest and broadest depression on Mars, and is characterized by a complex pattern of fracture sets, lobate scarps, grabens, and volcanic plains. The numerous lobate scarps in the circum-Hellas region mainly formed in the Late Noachian and, except Amenthes Rupes, have been scarcely studied. In this work, we study the mechanical behavior and thermal structure of the crust in the circum-Hellas region at the time of lobate scarp formation, through the modeling of the depth of faulting beneath several prominent lobate scarps. We obtain faulting depths between ∼13 and 38km, depending on the lobate scarp and accounting for uncertainty. These results indicate low surface and mantle heat flows in Noachian to Early Hesperian times, in agreement with heat flow estimates derived from lithospheric strength for several regions of similar age on Mars. Also, faulting depth and associate heat flows are not dependent of the local crustal thickness, which supports a stratified crust in the circum-Hellas region, with heat-producing elements concentrated in an upper layer that is thinner than the whole crust.},

abstract = {Early in terrestrial planet evolution energetic impact, radiodecay, and core formation may have created one or more whole or partial silicate mantle magma oceans. The time to mantle solidification and then to clement surface conditions allowing liquid water is highly dependent upon heat flux from the planetary surface through a growing primitive atmosphere. Here we model the time to clement conditions for whole and partial magma oceans on the Earth and Mars, and the resulting silicate mantle volatile compositions. Included in our calculations are partitioning of water and carbon dioxide between solidifying mantle cumulate mineral assemblages, evolving liquid compositions, and a growing atmosphere. We find that small initial volatile contents (0.05 wt.{\%} H2O, 0.01 wt.{\%} CO2) can produce atmospheres in excess of 100 bars, and that mantle solidification is 98{\%} complete in less than 5 Myr for all magma oceans investigated on both Earth and Mars, and less than 100,000 yr for low-volatile magma oceans. Subsequent cooling to clement surface conditions occurs in five to tens of Ma, underscoring the likelihood of serial magma oceans and punctuated clement conditions in the early planets. Cumulate mantles are volatile-bearing and stably stratified following solidification, inhibiting the onset of thermal convection but allowing for further water and carbon emissions from volcanoes even in the absence of plate tectonics. Models thus produce a new hypothetical starting point for mantle evolution in the terrestrial planets.},

abstract = {We present a spherical harmonic solution of the static gravity field of Mars to degree and order 120, GMM-3, that has been calculated using the Deep Space Network tracking data of the NASA Mars missions, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Odyssey (ODY), and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). We have also jointly determined spherical harmonic solutions for the static and time-variable gravity field of Mars, and the Mars k2 Love numbers, exclusive of the gravity contribution of the atmosphere. Consequently, the retrieved time-varying gravity coefficients and the Love number k2 solely yield seasonal variations in the mass of the polar caps and the solid tides of Mars, respectively. We obtain a Mars Love number k2 of 0.1697 ± 0.0027 (3-$\sigma$). The inclusion of MRO tracking data results in improved seasonal gravity field coefficients C30 and, for the first time, C50. Refinements of the atmospheric model in our orbit determination program have allowed us to monitor the odd zonal harmonic C30 for ∼1.5 solar cycles (16 years). This gravity model shows improved correlations with MOLA topography up to 15{\%} larger at higher harmonics (l = 60–80) than previous solutions.},

abstract = {The martian elastic lithosphere thickness Te has recently been constrained by modeling the geodynamical response to loading at the martian polar caps and Te was found to exceed 300 km at the north pole today. Geological evidence suggests that Mars has been volcanically active in the recent past and we have reinvestigated the martian thermal evolution, identifying models which are consistent with Te{\textgreater}300 km and the observed recent magmatic activity. We find that although models satisfying both constraints can be constructed, special assumptions regarding the concentration and distribution of radioactive elements, the style of mantle convection and/or the mantle's volatile content need to be made. If a dry mantle rheology is assumed, strong plumes caused by, e.g., a strongly pressure dependent mantle viscosity or endothermic phase transitions near the core–mantle boundary are required to allow for decompression melting in the heads of mantle plumes. For a wet mantle, large mantle water contents of the order of 1000 ppm are required to allow for partial mantle melting. Also, for a moderate crustal enrichment of heat producing, elements the planet's bulk composition needs to be 25 and 50{\%} sub-chondritic for dry and wet mantle rheologies, respectively. Even then, models resulting in a globally averaged elastic thicknesses of Te{\textgreater}300 km are difficult to reconcile with most elastic thickness estimates available for the Hesperian and Amazonian periods. It therefore seems likely that large elastic thicknesses in excess of 300 km are not representative for the bulk of the planet and that Te possibly shows a large degree of spatial heterogeneity.},

A phase of rapid lithospheric growth is observed during the Hesperian and we propose that this elastic thickness history is a consequence of the martian crustal rheology and its thermal evolution. A wet crustal rheology is found to generate a mechanically incompetent layer in the lower crust during the early evolution and the rapid growth of Te during the Hesperian results from the disappearance of this layer due to planetary cooling. The incompetent layer and the related rapid lithospheric growth are absent for a dry basaltic crustal rheology, which is therefore incompatible with the observations. Furthermore, we find that the observed elastic thickness evolution is best compatible with a wet mantle rheology, although a dry mantle cannot be ruled out. It therefore seems likely that rheologically significant amounts of water were retained in the Martian crust and mantle after planetary accretion.},

Crater counts of key surface units associated with the faulting indicate a scarp emplacement in the late Noachian–early Hesperian periods between 4.0 and 3.7 Gyr. The seismogenic layer thickness at the time of faulting is constrained to 27–35 km and 21–28 km for the two scarps investigated, implying paleo geothermal gradients of 12–18 and 15–23 K km−1, corresponding to heat flows of 24–36 and 30–46 mW m−2. The heat flow values obtained in this study are considerably lower than those derived from rift flank uplift at the close-by Coracis Fossae for a similar time period, indicating that surface heat flow is a strong function of regional setting. If viewed as representative for magmatically active and inactive regions, the thermal gradients at rifts and scarps span the range of admissible global mean values. This implies dT/dz=17–32 Kkm−1, with the true value probably being closer to the lower bound.},

abstract = {Volcanic outgassing is one of the main sources of volatiles for the martian atmosphere and degassing of the martian interior potentially influenced the early martian climate. Using a parameterized thermo-chemical evolution model and considering two end-member melting models, we self-consistently calculate the amount of CO2 and H2O outgassed during the martian evolution. Outgassing rates are found to depend primarily on a factor describing the outgassing efficiency, the bulk mantle water content, the mantle oxygen fugacity, and the local melt fraction in the magma source regions. We find that significant outgassing ceased around 3.5–2Gyr ago, depending on the adopted melting model. A total of 0.9–1bar CO2 is outgassed during this time period if a mantle oxygen fugacity corresponding to one log10 unit above the iron–wustite buffer is assumed. Additionally, a total of 17–61m of water is delivered to the surface. Outgassing is most efficient in the pre-Noachian (up to 4.1Gyr), but still significant during the Noachian, and 5–15m of water and ∼250mbar of CO2 are outgassed between 4.1 and 3.7Gyr. Although this amount is probably insufficient for an appreciable greenhouse effect, pressures are found to be sufficient to stabilize transient liquid water on the surface well into the Hesperian period. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that rather than being warm-and-wet, the martian climate was probably cold-and-wet. Outgassing is found to strongly decline during the Hesperian, and is insignificant during the Amazonian period. A simple parameterization for the outgassing of CO2 and H2O as a function of time is presented.},

abstract = {The Tyrrhena Patera highland volcano, Mars, is associated with a relatively well localized gravity anomaly and we have carried out a localized admittance analysis in the region to constrain the density of the volcanic load, the load thickness, and the elastic thickness at the time of load emplacement. The employed admittance model considers loading of an initially spherical surface, and surface as well as subsurface loading is taken into account. Our results indicate that the gravity and topography data available at Tyrrhena Patera is consistent with the absence of subsurface loading, but the presence of a small subsurface load cannot be ruled out. We obtain minimum load densities of 2960kgm−3, minimum load thicknesses of 5km, and minimum load volumes of 0.6×106km3. Photogeological evidence suggests that pyroclastic deposits make up at most 30{\%} of this volume, such that the bulk of Tyrrhena Patera is likely composed of competent basalt. Best fitting model parameters are a load density of 3343kgm−3, a load thickness of 10.8km, and a load volume of 1.7×106km3. These relatively large load densities indicate that lava compositions are comparable to those at other martian volcanoes, and densities are comparable to those of the martian meteorites. The elastic thickness in the region is constrained to be smaller than 27.5km at the time of loading, indicating surface heat flows in excess of 24mWm−2.},

abstract = {[1] Martian thermal state and evolution depend principally on the radiogenic heat‐producing element (HPE) distributions in the planet's crust and mantle. The Gamma‐Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft has mapped the surface abundances of HPEs across Mars. From these data, we produce the first models of global and regional surface heat production and crustal heat flow. As previous studies have suggested that the crust is a repository for approximately 50{\%} of the radiogenic elements on Mars, these models provide important, directly measurable constraints on Martian heat generation. Our calculations show considerable geographic and temporal variations in crustal heat flow, and demonstrate the existence of anomalous heat flow provinces. We calculate a present day average surface heat production of 4.9 ± 0.3 × 10 −11 W {\textperiodcentered} kg −1 . We also calculate the average crustal component of heat flow of 6.4 ± 0.4 mW {\textperiodcentered} m −2 . The crustal component of radiogenically produced heat flow ranges from {\textless}1 mW {\textperiodcentered} m −2 in the Hellas Basin and Utopia Planitia regions to ∼13 mW {\textperiodcentered} m −2 in the Sirenum Fossae region.

@article{Halliday2001,
abstract = {The depletion of moderately volatile elements in planetesimals and planets is generally considered to be a result of removal of hot nebula gases. This theory can be tested with Sr isotopes. The calculated initial 87Sr/86Sr of the angrite parent body (APB), eucrite parent body (EPB), the Moon and the Earth are significantly higher than the initial Sr isotopic composition of the solar system despite the volatile-depleted nature of all of these objects. Calculated time-scales required to accomplish these increases in 87Sr/86Sr with a solar Rb/Sr in a nebula environment are {\textgreater}2 Myr for the APB, {\textgreater}3 Myr for the EPB and {\textgreater}10 Myr for the Moon. These times are more than an order of magnitude longer than that expected for cooling the nebula in the terrestrial planet-forming region and correspond to the period during which most of the mass already should have been accreted into sizeable planetesimals and even planets. Therefore, incomplete condensation of the nebula does not provide an adequate explanation for the depletion in moderately volatile elements. The data are better explained by a protracted history of depletion via more than one mechanism, including processes completely divorced from the earliest cooling of the circumstellar disk. The Sr model ages are maximum formation ages of the APB and EPB and indicate that these are most probably secondary objects. With independent estimates of their minimum age, a time-integrated Rb/Sr can be calculated for the precursor materials from which they formed. These are consistent with accretion of the APB and EPB from objects that at one stage may have resembled carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies in terms of volatile budgets. At some late stage there were large losses of volatiles, the most likely mechanism for which is very energetic collisions between planetesimals and proto-planets that, in the case of the Asteroid Belt, have since been lost. The same applies to the Moon, which presently has Rb/Sr=0.006 even though the material from which it formed had a time-integrated Rb/Sr ratio of ∼0.07, consistent with a precursor planet (Theia) that was even less volatile element-depleted than the present Earth (Rb/Sr=0.03). The time-integrated Rb/Sr of Theia is similar to the present Rb/Sr of Mars (0.07). There is suggestive evidence of a similar time-integrated value for the proto-Earth (∼0.09). Therefore, prior to the later stages of planet formation involving giant impacts between large objects, the inner solar system may have had relatively uniform concentrations of moderately volatile elements broadly similar to those found in volatile-depleted chondrites. Correlations of the present Rb/Sr ratios in planets and planetesimals with ratios of other volatile elements to Sr can be used to infer the time-integrated composition of precursor materials. The time-integrated inferred K/U ratios of the proto-Earth, as well as Theia, were ∼20 000, so that early radioactive heat production may have been ∼40{\%} greater than that calculated by extrapolating back from the Earth's present K/U. Higher C and S bulk concentrations may have led to concentrations in proto-cores of 0.6–1.5{\%} C and 4–10{\%} S. These are significantly higher than those anticipated from the degree of volatile depletion of the present silicate Earth (∼0.12{\%} C, ∼1.3{\%} S). If the late history of accretion did not involve large-scale re-equilibration of silicates and metal, the present core may have inherited such high C and S concentrations. In this case, S would be the dominant light element in the present core.},

Both Vp and Vs were found to correlate linearly with porosity and clay content in shaly sandstones.

abstract = {The northern lowlands cover approximately one-third of Mars' surface and are a fundamental part of the geologic evolution of Mars. We examine the admittance signature, the ratio of gravity to topography data in the spectral domain, for four regions in the northern lowlands that are both well resolved in the gravity data and have well constrained lithospheric parameters. These regions also have topographic power spectra similar to many highlands regions. A Cartesian multitaper method is used to calculate admittance. We compare the observed admittance signatures to those predicted from models of lithospheric flexure. On the basis of these comparisons, we estimate the thickness of the Martian elastic lithosphere (Te) required to support the observed topographic load since the time of loading. We use both top and bottom loading models to derive values of elastic thickness and crustal thickness or apparent depth of compensation although all four regions are best fit by bottom loading models. We obtain best fit elastic thickness estimates between 10 and 25 km with an acceptable error range of 0 to 45 km. These low elastic thickness estimates are consistent with the formation in the Noachian, when heat flow was high. The consistency in Te estimates between the Noachian highlands and lowlands basement suggests that both regions of the crust formed at similar times. The paucity of crustal magnetization in the lowlands is thus more likely a result of demagnetization than formation following shut down of the dynamo.},

However, such fundamental issues as the dominant mechanisms of flow have not been well resolved. A synthesis of laboratory studies and geophysical and geological observations shows that transitions between diffusion and dislocation creep likely occur in the Earth's upper mantle. The hot and shallow upper mantle flows by dislocation creep, whereas cold and shallow or deep upper mantle may flow by diffusion creep. When the stress increases, grain size is reduced and the upper mantle near the transition between these two regimes is weakened. Consequently, deformation is localized and the upper mantle is decoupled mechanically near these depths.},

@article{Keller2009,
abstract = {In order to find an explanation for the origin of the martian crustal dichotomy, a number of recent papers have examined the effect of layered viscosity on the evolution of a degree-1 mantle convection, e.g. Roberts and Zhong [Roberts, J.H., Zhong, S., 2006. J. Geophys. Res. 111. E06013] and Yoshida and Kageyama [Yoshida, M., Kageyama, A., 2006. J. Geophys. Res. 111, doi:10.1029/2005JB003905. B03412]. It was found that a mid-mantle viscosity jump, combined with highly temperature- and depth-dependent rheology, are effective in developing a degree-1 convection within a short timescale. Such a layered viscosity profile could be justified by martian mineralogy. However, the effect of a degree-1 convective planform on the crustal thickness distribution has not yet been demonstrated. It is not obvious whether a thinner crust, due to sublithospheric erosion and crustal thinning, or a thicker crust, due to enhanced crustal production, would form above the hemisphere of mantle upwelling. Also, the general shape of the dichotomy, which is not strictly hemispherical, has not yet been fully investigated. Here we propose a model of the crustal patterns produced by numerical simulations of martian mantle convection, using the finite-volume multigrid code StagYY [Tackley, P.J., 2008. Phys. Earth Planet. Int. 107, 7–18, doi:10.1016/j.pepi.2008.08.005] A self-consistent treatment of melting, crustal formation and chemical differentiation has been added to models of three-dimensional thermal convection. This allows us to obtain global maps of the crustal thickness distribution as it evolves with time. The obtained results demonstrate that it is indeed possible to form a crustal dichotomy as a consequence of near degree-1 mantle convection early in Mars' history. We find that some of the observed patterns show intriguing first order similarities to the elliptical shape of the martian dichotomy. In all models, the region of thick crust is located over the region of mantle upwelling, which itself is a ridge-like structure spread over roughly one half of the planet, a planform we describe as “one-ridge convection.”},

@article{Kiefer2004,
abstract = {Syrtis Major is an ancient basaltic shield volcano on Mars with a basal diameter of 1100 km. The free-air gravity anomaly is 126 mGal at spherical harmonic degree 50 and reaches its maximum amplitude over the 2 km deep topographic caldera. The observed gravity anomaly cannot be explained by flexurally supported surface topography and requires the presence of a buried, high-density load. The geologically most reasonable interpretation of this high-density load is that it represents the magma chamber of Syrtis Major, now solidified and filled at least in part by dense igneous cumulates. Pyroxene is likely to be the dominant cumulate mineral in this system, although olivine may also be present. Gravity models presented here define the structure of the buried load and in essence provide a look at the magmatic plumbing system of this volcano. The preferred model involves a buried load that is approximately 300×600 km across, roughly twice as large as the topographic caldera. Both the buried load and the caldera are elongated in the north-south direction. In the center of the buried load, the minimum thickness is 2.8 km for an olivine-dominated cumulate system or 3.9 km for a pyroxene-dominated system. The best terrestrial analog for this structure is the Bushveld Complex, an igneous cumulate body that is similar in size and thickness to the Syrtis Major structure. Assuming that the mean crustal density is 2600 kg m-3 due to impact brecciation, the elastic lithosphere at Syrtis Major was 10–15 km thick at the time when the topographic load was emplaced. This corresponds to a lithospheric thermal gradient of 28--52 K/km and a surface heat flux of 70--130 mW m-2. Higher resolution gravity data, such as that which is planned for the 2005 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, will permit further refinement of the dimensions of this structure.},

abstract = {The launch sites for Martian (SNC) meteorites remain unknown, but they must derive from young volcanic provinces. We present the first geologic and spectroscopic characteristics of a suite of relatively dust-free lava flows that extend from underneath the regional dust cover on the south flank of the Tharsis volcanic province on Mars. The purpose of this work is to (1) characterize these flows geologically by using THermal EMission Imaging System (THEMIS) data supplemented by Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA), Mars Orbital Camera (MOC), and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) datasets and (2) use Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) data in order to test the hypothesis that Tharsis represents a source for the SNCs. These flows are morphologically similar to flood lavas in Amazonis Planitia with the flow surfaces being a complex mixture of surficial materials with limited exposure. The spectrally derived mineral composition and geochemistry for three flows, reveals basaltic compositions that have an affinity with SNCs, especially the basaltic shergottites. However, discrepancies between spectra and mineral percentages for the flows versus the shergottites, together with the observation of surface deposits on the flow surfaces, make any connection between these flows and the SNCs tenuous, although not impossible. Further testing of a Tharsis–SNC relationship will require measurements at finer spatial resolutions, perhaps even in-situ.},

abstract = {We derive the bulk chemical composition, physical properties, and trace element abundances of Mars from two assumptions: (1) Mars is the parent body for the Shergottite–Nakhlite–Chassignite (SNC) meteorites, and (2) the oxygen isotopic composition of Mars was determined by the oxygen isotopic compositions of the different types of nebular material that accreted to form Mars. We use oxygen isotopes to constrain planetary bulk compositions because oxygen is generally the most abundant element in rock, and is either the first or second (after iron) most abundant element in any terrestrial planet, the Moon, other rocky satellites, and the asteroids. The oxygen isotopic composition of Mars, calculated from oxygen isotopic analyses of the SNC meteorites, corresponds to the accretion of about 85{\%} H-, 11{\%} CV-, and 4{\%} CI-chondritic material. (Unless noted otherwise, mass percentages are used in this paper.) The bulk composition of Mars follows from mass balance calculations using mean compositions for these chondrite groups. We predict that silicates (mantle + crust) comprise about 80{\%} of Mars. The composition of the silicate fraction represents the composition of the primordial martian mantle prior to crustal formation. The FeO content of the mantle is 17.2{\%}. A metal–sulfide core, containing about 10.6{\%} S, makes up the remaining 20{\%} of the planet. Our bulk composition is similar to those from other models. We calculate the abundances of siderophile (“metal-loving”) and chalcophile (“sulfide-loving”) elements in the martian mantle from the bulk composition using (metal–sulfide)/silicate partition coefficients. Our results generally agree with predictions of the SNC meteorite model of W{\"{a}}nke and Dreibus for the composition of Mars. However, we predict higher abundances for the alkalis and halogens than those derived from SNC meteorite models for Mars. The apparent discrepancy indicates that the alkalis and halogens were lost from the martian mantle by hydrothermal leaching and/or vaporization during accretion. Geochemical arguments suggest that vaporization was only a minor loss process for these elements. On the other hand, aqueous transport of the alkalis and halogens to the surface is supported by the terrestrial geochemistry of these elements and the high K, Rb, Cl, and Br abundances found by the Viking XRF and Phobos gamma ray experiments on the surface of Mars.},

abstract = {A 'near Mars object' that got too near is a possible explanation for one of the most prominent features we see on Mars the north-south dichotomy of the planet's surface appearance. The southern highlands on Mars cover about 60 of the planet and are heavily cratered, while the northern lowlands are lightly cratered, are geologically younger, and the underlying crust is significantly thinner than in the south. The two favoured explanations for this 'hemispheric dichotomy' are mantle convection and a giant impact, but there is little available evidence to distinguish between the theories. Three Letters in this issue provide support for the giant impact model. Marinova et al. present the results of dynamical simulations of dichotomy-forming impacts that demonstrate the feasibility of a giant impact origin. Andrews-Hanna et al. use the gravity and topography of Mars to map the dichotomy boundary beneath the large Tharsis volcanic province, and find the boundary to be elliptical, consistent with an oblique giant impact origin. This 'Borealis basin' would be the largest impact scar in the Solar System. Nimmo et al. use numerical modelling to simulate the effects of vertical impacts. They find that the impact model, as well as excavating a crustal cavity of the correct size, can explain the observed crustal disruption and the formation of the northern lowlands crust by impact-generated melt.},

We further show that a capable long-range laser altimeter can improve determination of the spacecraft position, improve the k2 determination ({\textless}1{\%} error), and enable the estimation of the planetary shape and Love number h2 (3–4{\%} error), which is directly related to the amplitude of the surface tidal deformation. These measurements, in addition to the global shape accurately constrained by the long altimetric profiles, can yield further constraints on the interior structure of Europa.},

@article{McDonough1995,
abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an Fe--Ni core having between 5{\%} and 15{\%} of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at ∼ 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (∼ 10 ± 5{\%}) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk FeAl of ∼ 20 ± 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (∼ 14{\%}) and the core (∼ 86{\%}). Chondritic meteorites display a range of FeAl ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's.},

abstract = {Present-day averaged temperature profiles of the mantle of Mars are computed through numerical convection experiments performed with axisymmetrical geometry, for different values of core radii and different boundary conditions at the core-mantle boundary. Internal heating of the mantle is considered in each case. It is found that the temperature profiles of the mantle are very stable whatever the imposed conditions at the core-mantle boundary. A 300 km thick thermal lithosphere, displaying a temperature gradient equal to 4.4 K km−1 is followed at greater depths by a quasi-isothermal mantle, the temperature of which is found in a 1200–1600 K temperature range. A mean temperature equal to 1400 K is in a good agreement with the low Q of Mars at tidal frequencies. These characteristics, together with the small increase of pressure with depth, of the order of 0.01 GPa km−1, induce the presence of a low-velocity zone similar to the Earth's one, down to 300 km depth. Densities and seismic velocities corresponding to these thermodynamical conditions are computed using Gr{\"{u}}neisen's and third-order finite strain theory for different values of the iron content of mantle minerals. Below 300 km depth, the values of magnitude as within the Earth's transition zone. An increase of the iron content of the Martian mantle with respect to the Earth's one results (1) in an increase of density, and a decrease of seismic velocities, which can reach more than 2{\%} of the values expected from an Earth like composition, (2) in a homogenization of mantle structure through the smoothing out of seismic discontinuities over a thickness of a few hundred kilometres. This smoothing process is due to the large pressure domains of coexistence between different phases of olivine when the iron content of this latter mineral increases. Plausible domains of core density and core radius are finally checked back for each of the computed models of mantle density. These tests show that the principal moment of inertia ratio of Mars should not be lower than 0.355 if the iron content of the Martian mantle is at least equal to that of the Earth, and that the thickness of the liquid core should be small, of the order of 300–400 km, if a solid core is present at the centre of the planet. This small thickness might explain the weakness (or absence?) of an internally generated magnetic field on Mars.},

abstract = {The composition of Mars has been calculated from the cosmochemical model of Ganapathy and Anders (1974) which assumes that planets and chondrites underwent the same 4 fractionation processes in the solar nebula. Because elements of similar volatility stay together in these processes, only 4 index elements (U, Fe, K and Tl or Ar36) are needed to calculate the abundances of all 83 elements in the planet. The values chosen are U = 28 ppb, K = 62 ppm (based on KU = 2200 from orbital $\gamma$-spectrometry and on thermal history calculations by Toks{\"{o}}z and Hsui (1978) Fe = 26.72{\%} (from geophysical data), and Tl = 0.14 ppb (from the Ar36 and Ar40 abundances measured by Viking). The mantle of Mars is an iron-rich [Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 0.77] garnet wehrlite ($\rho$ = 3.52−3.54 g/cm3), similar to McGetchin and Smyth's (1978) estimate but containing more Ca and Al. It is nearly identical to the bulk Moon composition of Morgan et al. (1978b). The core makes up 0.19 of the planet and contains 3.5{\%} S—much less than estimated by other models. Volatiles have nearly Moon-like abundances, being depleted relative to the Earth by factors of 0.36 (K-group, Tcond = 600–1300 K) or 0.029 (Tl group, Tcond {\textless} 600 K). The water abundance corresponds to a 9 m layer, but could be higher by as much as a factor of 11. Comparison of model compositions for 5 differentiated planets (Earth, Venus, Mars, Moon, and eucrite parent body) suggests that volatile depletion correlates mainly with size rather than with radial distance from the Sun. However, the relatively high volatile content of shergottites and some chondrites shows that the correlation is not simple; other factors must also be involved.},

@article{Morschhauser2011,
abstract = {We have reinvestigated the coupled thermal and crustal evolution of Mars taking new laboratory data concerning the flow behavior of iron-rich olivine into account. The low mantle viscosities associated with the relatively higher iron content of the martian mantle as well as the observed high concentrations of heat producing elements in a crust with a reduced thermal conductivity were found to promote phases of crustal recycling in many models. As crustal recycling is incompatible with an early separation of geochemical reservoirs, models were required to show no episodes of crustal recycling. Furthermore, admissible models were required to reproduce the martian crust formation history, to allow for the formation of partial melt under present day mantle conditions and to reproduce the measured concentrations of potassium and thorium on the martian surface. Taking dehydration stiffening of the mantle viscosity by the extraction of water from the mantle into account, we found that admissible models have low initial upper mantle temperatures around 1650K, preferably a primordial crustal thickness of 30km, and an initially wet mantle rheology. The crust formation process on Mars would then be driven by the extraction of a primordial crust after core formation, cooling the mantle to temperatures close to the peridotite solidus. According to this scenario, the second stage of global crust formation took place over a more extended period of time, waning at around 3500Myr b.p., and was driven by heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements. Present-day volcanism would then be driven by mantle plumes originating at the core–mantle boundary under regions of locally thickened, thermally insulating crust. Water extraction from the mantle was found to be relatively efficient and close to 40{\%} of the total inventory was lost from the mantle in most models. Assuming an initial mantle water content of 100ppm and that 10{\%} of the extracted water is supplied to the surface, this amount is equivalent to a 14m thick global surface layer, suggesting that volcanic outgassing of H2O could have significantly influenced the early martian climate and increased the planet's habitability.},

abstract = {The impact heat accumulated during the late stage of planetary accretion can melt a significant part or even the entire mantle of a terrestrial body, giving rise to a global magma ocean. [...] Assuming fractional crystallization of the magma ocean, dense cumulates are produced close to the surface, largely due to iron enrichment in the evolving magma ocean liquid (Elkins-Tanton et al., 2003). A gravitationally unstable mantle thus forms, which is prone to overturn. We investigate the cumulate overturn and its influence on the thermal evolution of Mars using mantle convection simulations in 2D cylindrical geometry. We present a suite of simulations using different initial conditions and a strongly temperature-dependent viscosity. We assume that all radiogenic heat sources have been enriched during the freezing-phase of the magma ocean in the uppermost 50 km and that the initial steam-atmosphere created by the degassing of the freezing magma ocean was rapidly lost, implying that the surface temperature is set to present-day values. In this case, a stagnant lid forms rapidly on top of the convective interior preventing the uppermost dense cumulates to sink, even when allowing for a plastic yielding mechanism. Below this dense stagnant lid, the mantle chemical gradient settles to a stable configuration. The convection pattern is dominated by small-scale structures, which are difficult to reconcile with the large-scale volcanic features observed over Mars' surface and partial melting ceases in less than 900 Ma. Assuming that the stagnant lid can break because of additional mechanisms and allowing the uppermost dense layer to overturn, a stable density gradient is obtained, with the densest material and the entire amount of heat sources lying above the CMB. This stratification leads to a strong overheating of the lowermost mantle [...]},

abstract = {Key Points: • Evolution models show that Mars' present-day Urey ratio varies by less than 10{\%} • Urey ratio is mainly sensitive to mantle cooling efficiency, Th, and U abundance • Urey ratio and InSight heat flow measurement can constrain Mars' heat budget Abstract The upcoming InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission, to be launched in 2016, will carry out the first in situ Martian heat flux measurement, thereby providing an important baseline to constrain the present-day heat budget of the planet and, in turn, the thermal and chemical evolution of its interior. The surface heat flux can be used to constrain the amount of heat-producing elements present in the interior if the Urey ratio (Ur)—the planet's heat production rate divided by heat loss—is known. We used numerical simulations of mantle convection to model the thermal evolution of Mars and determine the present-day Urey ratio for a variety of models and parameters. We found that Ur is mainly sensitive to the efficiency of mantle cooling, which is associated with the temperature dependence of the viscosity (thermostat effect), and to the abundance of long-lived radiogenic isotopes. If the thermostat effect is efficient, as expected for the Martian mantle, assuming typical solar system values for the thorium-uranium ratio and a bulk thorium concentration, simulations show that the present-day Urey ratio is approximately constant, independent of model parameters. Together with an estimate of the average surface heat flux as determined by InSight, models of the amount of heat-producing elements present in the primitive mantle can be constrained.},

abstract = {The primary objectives of this paper are to determine the modal mineralogy of selected low albedo terrains of different ages ranging from Noachian to Amazonian exposed on the surface of Mars. This analysis is conducted using the spectral modeling of the Observatoire pour la Min{\'{e}}ralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activit{\'{e}} (OMEGA) reflectance data. Results from this work are consistent with the major results of previous spectroscopic studies: plagioclase (40–60{\%} in volume) and high calcium pyroxene (20–40{\%}, HCP) are the dominant minerals of the most regions. Low calcium pyroxene (10–15{\%}, LCP) and minor amounts of olivine are also present. The oldest terrains are characterized by the largest amount of LCP and the lowest concentration of plagioclase. These overall compositions are consistent with two-pyroxene basalts. The particle sizes are in the range of a few hundreds of micrometers, which is in good agreement with the thermal inertia of the martian low albedo regions. In the region around the Nili Fossae, localized concentrations of olivine up to 40{\%} with millimeter particle size similar to picritic basalts observed in situ by the Spirit rover in the Gusev crater are inferred. Chemical compositions are calculated for the first time from OMEGA spectra. They are quite consistent with Gusev rocks and shergottite compositions but they appear to be significantly SiO2-poorer than Thermal Emission Spectrometer data. A decreasing low calcium pyroxene abundance with the decreasing age of the low albedo regions is reported. This may be indicative of decreasing degree of partial melting as thermal flux decreases with time. We propose that the ancient Noachian-aged, LCP-rich terrains could have been formed from H2O-bearing melts. Then, dry, basaltic volcanism occurred leading to decreasing LCP abundance with time due to decreasing degree of partial melting. The olivine-bearing material modeled in Nili Fossae resembles the composition of ALH77005 and Chassigny meteorites consistent with prior studies. Implications on the formation of the basaltic Shergottites are discussed.},

abstract = {Introduction: The upper parts of the mantle of terres-trial planets are olivine-rich, with Fe/(Mg+Fe) ratios (Fe{\#}) lower than {\~{}}2{\%} for Mercury, up to 25-30{\%} for Mars, and intermediate compositions for the Earth, the Moon and Venus. Olivine represents more than 60 wt.{\%} of the Martian upper mantle [1], where pressure (P) and temperature (T) reach 13.5 GPa and 1700 K at 1100-km depth. Results from experiments carried out at low pressure ({\~{}} 0.3 GPa) indicate that increasing Fe content dramatically decreases olivine viscosity [2]. These data suggest that the Martian upper mantle may be {\~{}}10 times less viscous than the Earth's at the same conditions. Whether such a weakening occurs at the high pressures relevant to Mars interior is unknown. Beside weakening olivine, increasing Fe content increases the sensitivity to stress of olivine plastic re-sponse [3], which translates into higher stress expo-nents in classical power laws such as: (1) , where  is the strain rate, A is a pre-exponential fac-tor,  the differential stress, fO 2 the oxygen fugacity, m is a constant, E * the activation energy, V * the activa-tion volume which quantifies the effect of pressure on viscosity (V* {\textgreater} 0 implies an increasing viscosity with P), and R the gas constant. High stress exponents pro-mote high viscosity contrasts between the hot deep upper mantle where small differential stresses are ex-pected ({\textless} 1 MPa in the Earth), and the colder shallow mantle where stresses are much higher ({\~{}}50 MPa at 1 GPa and 1100 K in the Earth). Large V* increase fur-ther the viscosity contrast, since they promote a dra-matic decrease in creep rates with increasing pressure. Moderate viscosity variations, i.e. typically within 1.5 order of magnitude throughout the Martian mantle, dramatically affect the planet thermal history and sur-face structures [4], and can even promote a Degree-1 convection -which could explain Mars' hemispheric dichotomy. It is, thus, critical to investigate the effect of Fe on olivine viscosity and stress sensitivity at the P-T conditions relevant to the Martian mantle. Here we show results from deformation experiments per-formed at high P on olivine polycrystals with different iron contents, leading to new estimates of the viscosity contrasts expected in the Martian upper mantle. Experiments: deformation experiments were car-ried out in axisymmetric compression in the Defor-mation-DIA apparatus (D-DIA) coupled with synchro-tron radiation [5], on olivine specimens {\~{}}1 mm in length with Fe{\#} ranging from 0 (pure forsterite, Fo100) to 100{\%} (pure fayalite, Fa100). The explored P and T ranges were 2.5 – 8.0 GPa and 1073 – 1573 K, and strain rate was in the range 0.2 – 14 × 10},

abstract = {Magmatism and volcanism have evolved the Martian lithosphere, surface, and climate throughout the history of Mars. Constraining the rates of magma generation and timing of volcanism on the surface clarifies the ways in which magma and volcanic activity have shaped these Martian systems. The ages of lava flows on other planets are often estimated using impact crater counts, assuming that the number and size-distribution of impact craters per unit area reflect the time the lava flow has been on the surface and exposed to potential impacts. Here we show that impact crater age model uncertainty is reduced by adding stratigraphic information observed at locations where neighboring lavas abut each other, and demonstrate the significance of this reduction in age uncertainty for understanding the history of a volcanic field comprising 29 vents in the 110-km-diameter caldera of Arsia Mons, Mars. Each vent within this caldera produced lava flows several to tens of kilometers in length; these vents are likely among the youngest on Mars, since no impact craters in their lava flows are larger than 1 km in diameter. First, we modeled the age of each vent with impact crater counts performed on their corresponding lava flows and found very large age uncertainties for the ages of individual vents, often spanning the estimated age for the entire volcanic field. The age model derived from impact crater counts alone is broad and unimodal, with estimated peak activity in the field around 130 Ma. Next we applied our volcano event age model (VEAM), which uses a directed graph of stratigraphic relationships and random sampling of the impact crater age determinations to create alternative age models. Monte Carlo simulation was used to create 10,000 possible vent age sets. The recurrence rate of volcanism is calculated for each possible age set, and these rates are combined to calculate the median recurrence rate of all simulations. Applying this approach to the 29 volcanic vents, volcanism likely began around 200–300 Ma then first peaked around 150 Ma, with an average production rate of 0.4 vents per Myr. The recurrence rate estimated including stratigraphic data is distinctly bimodal, with a second, lower peak in activity around 100 Ma. Volcanism then waned until the final vents were produced 10–90 Ma. Based on this model, volume flux is also bimodal, reached a peak rate of 1–8 km3 Myr−1 by 150 Ma and remained above half this rate until about 90 Ma, after which the volume flux diminished greatly. The onset of effusive volcanism from 200–150 Ma might be due to a transition of volcanic style away from explosive volcanism that emplaced tephra on the western flank of Arsia Mons, while the waning of volcanism after the 150 Ma peak might represent a larger-scale diminishing of volcanic activity at Arsia Mons related to the emplacement of flank apron lavas.},

They are unexpectedly high in silica and potassium, but low in magnesium compared to martian soils and martian meteorites. The analyzed rocks are similar in composition to terrestrial andesites and close to the mean composition of Earth's crust.

abstract = {We characterize the lithospheric structure of Isidis Planitia on Mars by analyzing Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey gravity and topography data using a flexural model of a thin elastic shell including bending and membrane stresses. Isidis Planitia is a circular, relatively flat plain formed near the end of the Early Noachian, at the edge of the highlands–lowlands boundary and the site of a large free-air gravity anomaly, features consistent with modification and filling of an impact basin. Our results suggest that the bulk density of the fill material inside Isidis must be more than 2600 kg m−3 and higher densities are probable. A comparison of the faulting observed at Nili Fossae to the predicted zone of extensional strain northwest of Isidis constrains the thickness of the elastic lithosphere to be 100–180 km thick beneath the basin at the time of loading. We also find that loads outside of the basin play a significant role in the interpretation of the tectonics; simplified models tend to overestimate the lithospheric thickness. We place relatively narrow bounds on the thermal gradient (3.4–6.5 K km−1) and heat flux (13.6–26 mW m−2) at Isidis at the time of loading.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the interior structure of Mars is of fundamental importance to the understanding of its past and present state as well as its future evolution. The most prominent interior structure properties are the state of the core, solid or liquid, its radius, and its composition in terms of light elements, the thickness of the mantle, its composition, the presence of a lower mantle, and the density of the crust. In the absence of seismic sounding only geodesy data allow reliably constraining the deep interior of Mars. Those data are the mass, moment of inertia, and tides. They are related to Mars' composition, to its internal mass distribution, and to its deformational response to principally the tidal forcing of the Sun. Here we use the most recent estimates of the moment of inertia and tidal Love number k2 in order to infer knowledge about the interior structure of the Mars. We have built precise models of the interior structure of Mars that are parameterized by the crust density and thickness, the volume fractions of upper mantle mineral phases, the bulk mantle iron concentration, and the size and the sulfur concentration of the core. From the bulk mantle iron concentration and from the volume fractions of the upper mantle mineral phases, the depth dependent mineralogy is deduced by using experimentally determined phase diagrams. The thermoelastic properties at each depth inside the mantle are calculated by using equations of state. Since it is difficult to determine the temperature inside the mantle of Mars we here use two end-member temperature profiles that have been deduced from studies dedicated to the thermal evolution of Mars. We calculate the pressure and temperature dependent thermoelastic properties of the core constituents by using equations state and recent data about reference thermoelastic properties of liquid iron, liquid iron–sulfur, and solid iron. To determine the size of a possible inner core we use recent data on the melting temperature of iron–sulfur. Within our model assumptions the geodesy data imply that Mars has no solid inner core and that the liquid core contains a large fraction of sulfur. The absence of a solid inner is in agreement with the absence of a global magnetic field. We estimate the radius of the core to be 1794±65km and its core sulfur concentration to be 16±2wt{\%}. We also show that it is possible for Mars to have a thin layer of perovskite at the bottom of the mantle if it has a hot mantle temperature. Moreover a chondritic Fe/Si ratio is shown to be consistent with the geodesy data, although significantly different value are also possible. Our results demonstrate that geodesy data alone, even if a mantle temperature is assumed, can almost not constrain the mineralogy of the mantle and the crust. In order to obtain stronger constraints on the mantle mineralogy bulk properties, like a fixed Fe/Si ratio, have to be assumed.},

abstract = {We present new numerical models for the thermochemical evolution of the mantle of Mars over the past 4Gy. Specifically, we have developed a parameterized model of composition and thermoelastic properties of mantle material and combined it with a two-dimensional, anelastic, compressible convection and melting algorithm in a spherical annulus geometry; these models include a detailed treatment of the effects of solid–solid phase transitions and of compositional changes that accompany generation and removal of mantle partial melt during magmatism. Among other questions, we examine if a perovskite+ferropericlase layer (pv+fp) exists at the base of the martian mantle, if long-lived plumes can explain the volcanic provinces, under which circumstances Mars may still be volcanically active, and how iron- and radionuclide-rich Mars is. Results of the models are compared with geophysical and chemical observations from spacecraft and information from martian meteorites. Most models yield crustal thicknesses between ∼75 and 90km, ancient depths for the Curie temperatures of possible magnetic carriers that include the entire crust, and mechanical lithosphere thicknesses that increased from less than 100km in the Noachian to 200–250km now. Generally, models with a large core, Mg{\#}=0.75, and radionuclide contents derived from those suggested by W{\"{a}}nke and Dreibus (Chemistry and accretion history of Mars. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A 349, 285–293, 1994) tend to explain observations best, but none of the models reproduces the full range of concentrations found in martian meteorites, thus implicitly supporting the idea that ancient chemical heterogeneities survive in the mantle. Only a subset of the models develops a pattern of mantle convection that evolves towards two or three large, long-lived plumes, and it takes at least ∼2Gy before this stage is reached, whereas models with a larger number of plumes or with plumes that are less stationary are more common. As Tharsis and probably Elysium are older than 2.5–3Gy, either model assumptions more complex than those made in this study or a dynamical mode different from low-degree convection with long-lived large plumes is required to explain these major volcanic provinces. The effect of the mid-mantle phase transitions on mantle dynamics is rather weak, so that whole-mantle convection prevails; however, a basal pv+fp layer would form a dynamically separate unit and decouple the mantle and core to some extent.},

abstract = {Surface heat flow calculations for the Amenthes region of Mars can be independently performed using the depth to the brittle–ductile transition and the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere estimated for the Late Noachian/Early Hesperian (equivalent to an estimated absolute age of ∼3.6–3.8 Ga). This, along with crustal heat production rates estimated from heat-producing elements abundances, permits us to put constraints, for that particular place and time, on both the thermal and mechanical properties of the lithosphere and the crustal thickness. The depth to the brittle–ductile transition deduced from modeling of the topography of Amenthes Rupes is 27–35 km, and the associated surface heat flow is 26–37 mW m−2. On the other hand, the effective elastic thickness in this region is between 19 and 35 km: the surface heat flow deduced by considering crustal and lithospheric mantle contributions to the total lithospheric strength, as well as wet or dry olivine for lithospheric mantle rheology, is 31–49 mW m−2. The relatively limited overlap among Te- and zBDT-based heat flow values implies a surface heat flow of 31–36 mW m−2 (with a high fraction originated from crustal heat sources) and a wet mantle rheology. The so obtained local crustal thickness is 43–74 km, which suggests an average thickness of ∼40–75 km for the Martian crust; for the frequently used crustal density of 2900 kg m−3, our results suggest a crustal thickness of 50–63 km for the Amenthes region, and an average crustal thickness of ∼45–65 km for Mars.},

abstract = {Heat flow calculations based on geological and/or geophysical indicators can help to constrain the thickness, and potentially the geochemical stratification, of the martian crust. Here we analyze the Warrego rise region, part of the ancient mountain range referred to as the Thaumasia highlands. This region has a crustal thickness much greater than the martian average, as well as estimations of the depth to the brittle–ductile transition beneath two scarps interpreted to be thrust faults. For the local crustal density (2900kgm−3) favored by our analysis of the flexural state of compensation of the local topography, the crustal thickness is at least 70 and 75km at the scarp locations. However, for one of the scarp locations our nominal model does not obtain heat flow solutions permitting a homogeneous crust as thick as required. Our results, therefore, suggest that the crust beneath the Warrego rise region is chemically stratified with a heat-producing enriched upper layer thinner than the whole crust. Moreover, if the mantle heat flow (at the time of scarp formation) was higher than 0.3 of the surface heat low, as predicted by thermal history models, then a stratified crust rise seems unavoidable for this region, even if local heat-producing element abundances lower than average or hydrostatic pore pressure are considered. This finding is consistent with a complex geological history, which includes magmatic-driven activity.},

Here we use a numerical model to investigate the dynamics of (i) the subducted oceanic crust and lithosphere, (ii) a deep layer chemically denser, relatively undegassed and enriched in radiogenic elements. Tracers carry U, Th, K, and He concentrations which vary due to radioactive decay and to partial melting and degassing processes. We investigate the stability of the denser layer and find that by considering a depth dependent thermal expansion coefficient and temperature dependent viscosity, a layer with a chemical density excess of 2.4{\%} can remain stable and poorly mixed until present-day time. The calculated helium ratios are in good agreement with 3He/4He observed at ridges and hotspots and show that the large spectrum of helium ratios of OIB can be explained by mixing between undegassed material, recycled oceanic crust and lithosphere. For MORB, the sharp spectrum of helium ratios may be due to a degassed, homogeneous and well mixed shallow mantle.},

abstract = {SNC meteorites (Shergottites, Nakhlites and Chassigny) define a fractionation line in a $\delta$17O/$\delta$18O diagram as expected for rocks differentiated from a formerly homogenized parent body, which is intermediate between H ordinary chondrites and EH enstatite chondrites. The planet Mars is located between the Earth and the asteroid belts, the potential source of ordinary chondrites. Since oxygen is a major component of the terrestrial planets, our model assumes that Mars composition is a mixture of two chondritic sources whose proportions are calculated by mass balance based on oxygen isotopes only. Two possible model compositions can be derived: if the average isotopic composition of SNC is relaxed along its fractionation line (Model 1) and if the end members are average H and EH chondrites, one obtains a 30:70 H:EH mixture. If the average isotopic composition of SNC is a robust feature, then an extreme composition of H chondrites must be selected which yields the proportion, 55:45 for the H:EH components. This composition carries the same oxygen isotopic composition as the iron inclusions in the IIE of the conjectured end member of the ordinary chondrite group. The proportions obtained this way enable to calculate two model compositions for all the refractory elements and oxygen. Model 1 can be discarded as it does not permit to fit reasonably the physical properties of the planet. Mass and composition of the core (Model 2) is easily derived (23{\%} of Mars mass, containing 16{\%} S); the remainder forming the bulk mantle composition. Comparison with recent estimates based on the composition of SNC meteorites reveals only minor differences, essentially for Si, Mg and Fe; this is because of our choice of non-CI chondritic composition, unlike previous models. Discussion of the assumptions made in previous models confirms that the new composition is in agreement with the SNC compositions. The model also permits to calculate adequate physical properties of the planet like its zero pressure mantle density, density profile with depth and dimensionless moment of inertia. The superiority of the present model resides in the minimal number of necessary hypotheses and the possibility to test it, using physical and chemical data about the planet: as far as we know of, all constraints can be satisfied within the errors of the measurements or uncertainty of the model. The Fe abundance and the low Mg/Si ratio imply that pyroxenes and garnet at depth will play a major role in the differentiation of the planet, a feature which differs markedly from the terrestrial mantle.},

We invert for V P , V S and hypocentre location within 50 × 50 × 20 km 3 volumes, using 266 969 P and 148 249 S arrival times. We obtain high-fidelity images of seismic velocities with resolution on the order of a few kilometres from 2 to 12 km depth and validate the results using checkerboard tests. Due to the relatively large proportion of S-wave arrival times, we also obtain stable maps of V P /V S ratios in both regions. The velocity of the Trifurcation Area as a whole is lower than adjacent unfaulted material. We interpret a 4-km-wide low velocity zone with high V P /V S ratio in the trifurcation itself as related to fault zone damage. We also observe clear velocity contrasts across the Buck Ridge, Clark and Coyote Creek segments of the SJFZ. The Anza segment of the SJFZ, to the NW of the trifurcation area, displays a strong (up to 27 per cent) contrast of V S from 2 to 9 km depth. In the Hot Springs area, a low velocity zone between the Claremont and Casa Loma Strands narrows with depth, with clear velocity contrasts observed across both segments. A roughly 10-km-wide zone of low velocity and low V P /V S ratio at the NW tip of the Hot Springs fault is indicative of either unconsolidated sediments associated with the San Jacinto basin, or fluid-filled cracks within a broad deformation zone. High V P /V S ratios along the Anza segment could indicate a preferred nucleation location for future large earthquakes, while the across-fault velocity contrast suggests a preferred northwest rupture propagation direction for such events.},

abstract = {While most of Tharsis rise was in place by end of the Noachian period, at least one volcano on Tharsis swell (Arsia Mons) has been active within the last 2 Ma. This places an important constraint on mantle convection and on the thermal evolution of Mars. The existence of recent volcanism on Mars implies that adiabatic decompression melting and, hence, upwelling convective flow in the mantle remains important on Mars at present. The thermal history on Mars can be constrained by the history of melt production, specifically generating sufficient melt in the first billion years of the planets history to produce Tharsis rise as well as present day melt to explain recent volcanism. In this work, mantle convection simulations were performed using finite element code CitcomS in a 3D sphere starting from a uniformly hot mantle and integrating forward in time for the age of the solar system. We implement constant and decaying radioactive heat sources; and vary the partitioning of heat sources between the crust and mantle, and consider decreasing core–mantle boundary temperature and latent heat of melting. The constant heat source calculations produce sufficient melt to create Tharsis early in Martian history and continue to produce significant melt to the present. Calculations with decaying radioactive heat sources generate excessive melt in the past, except when all the radiogenic elements are in the crust, and none produce melt after 2 Gyr. Producing a degree-1 or degree-2 structure may not be pivotal to explain the Tharsis rise: we present multi-plume models where not every plume produces melt. The Rayleigh number controls the timing of the first peak of volcanism while late-stage volcanism is controlled more by internal mantle heating. Decreasing the Rayleigh number increases the lithosphere thickness (i.e., depth), and increasing lithosphere thickness increases the mean mantle temperature. Increasing pressure reduces melt production while increasing temperature increases melt production; hence predicting melt production from convection parameters is not straightforward. Generating enough melt in the mantle to create Tharsis early on and also to explain recent volcanism may require other mechanisms such as small-scale convection or lowering the thermal conductivity of the crust.},

A magnetic dynamo in a convecting fluid core magnetized the crust, and the global field shielded a more massive early atmosphere against solar wind stripping.

abstract = {Using a self-consistent computation of phase equilibria and physical properties, we determine isobaric velocity–temperature and velocity–density scalings as a function of depth, focusing on the upper 800 km. The scalings contain an isomorphic part due to the influence of temperature on the physical properties of individual phases, and a metamorphic part due to variation of phase abundances and compositions with temperature. We show that the contribution from phase transformations is comparable in magnitude to that of temperature alone, and has important consequences for mantle structure. Both scalings are highly non-linear functions of temperature and depth even in the elastic limit due to the influence of phase transitions: near sharp phase transitions seismic velocities become much more sensitive to temperature. We expect the magnitude of lateral variations in seismic velocity to vary rapidly with depth. This result has important implications for the interpretation of smoothed tomographic models, particularly in the upper 1000 km, and possibly the bottom few hundred km, where phase transformations have a large influence on the structure. It will be important to include the metamorphic contribution of the scalings in geodynamical studies relating seismic structure to thermal structure or the gravity field. We find that the combined phase buoyancy of transitions near 520 km depth is equal in magnitude to that of the olivine to wadsleyite transition and should be included in future dynamical studies.},

abstract = {An accurate assessment of the bulk chemical composition of Mars is fundamental to understanding planetary accretion, differentiation, mantle evolution, the nature of the igneous parent rocks that were altered to produce sediments on Mars, and the initial concentrations of volatiles such as H, Cl and S, important constituents of the Martian surface. This paper reviews the three main approaches that have been used to estimate the bulk chemical composition of Mars: geochemical/cosmochemical, isotopic, and geophysical. The standard model is one developed by W{\"{a}}nke and Dreibus in a series of papers, which is based on compositions of Martian meteorites. Since their groundbreaking work, substantial amounts of data have become available to allow a reassessment of the composition of Mars from elemental data, including tests of the basic assumptions in the geochemical models. The results adjust some of the concentrations in the W{\"{a}}nke–Dreibus model, but in general confirm its accuracy. Bulk silicate Mars has roughly uniform depletion of moderately volatile elements such as K (0.6×CI), and strong depletion of highly volatile elements (e.g., Tl). The highly volatile elements are within uncertainties uniformly depleted at about 0.06 CI abundances. The highly volatile chalcophile elements are likewise roughly uniformly depleted, but with more scatter, with normalized abundances of 0.03 CI. Bulk planetary H2O is much higher than estimated previously: it appears to be slightly less than in Earth, but D/H is similar in Earth and Mars, indicating a common source of water-bearing material in the inner solar system. K/Th ranges from ∼3000 to ∼5000 among the terrestrial planets, a small range compared to CI chondrites (19,000). FeO varies throughout the inner solar system: ∼3wt{\%} in Mercury, 8wt{\%} in Earth and Venus, and 18wt{\%} in Mars. These differences can be produced by varying oxidation conditions, hence do not suggest the terrestrial planets were formed from fundamentally different materials. The broad chemical similarities among the terrestrial planets indicate substantial mixing throughout the inner solar system during planet formation, as suggested by dynamical models.},

abstract = {In numerical simulations of mantle convection it is commonly assumed that the coefficients of thermal expansion $\alpha$ and thermal conduction k are either constant or pressure-dependent. Pressure changes are generally computed using parametrizations that rely on extrapolations of low-pressure data for a single upper-mantle phase. Here we collect data for both the pressure and temperature dependence of $\alpha$ from a database of first-principles calculations, and of k from recent experimental studies. We use these data-sets to construct analytical parametrizations of $\alpha$ and k for the major upper- and lower-mantle phases that can be easily incorporated into exisiting convection codes. We then analyze the impact of such parametrizations on Earth's mantle dynamics by employing two-dimensional numerical models of thermal convection. When $\alpha$ is the only variable parameter, both its temperature and pressure dependence enhance hot plumes and tend to inhibit the descent of cold downwellings. Taking into account a variable k leads to a strong increase of the bulk mantle temperature, which reduces the buoyancy available to amplify bottom boundary layer instabilities and causes mantle flow to be driven primarily by the instability of cold plates whose surface velocity also tends to rise. When both parameters are considered together, we observe an increased propensity to local layering which favors slab stagnation in the transition zone and subsequent thickening in the lower mantle. Furthermore, the values of k near the core-mantle boundary ultimately control the effect of this physical property on convection, which stresses the importance of determining the thermal conductivity of the post-perovskite phase.},

abstract = {We have used and extended Roosbeek's tidal potential for Mars to calculate tidal displacements, gravity variations, and external gravitational potential variations. The tides on Mars are caused by the Sun, and to a lesser degree by the natural satellites Phobos (8{\%}, relative to the Sun) and Deimos (0.08{\%}, relative to the Sun). To determine the reaction of Mars to the tidal forcing, the Love numbers h, l, and k and the gravimetric factor $\delta$ were calculated for interior models of Mars with different state, density, and radius of the core and for models which include mantle anelasticity. The latitude dependence and frequency dependence of the Love numbers have been taken explicitly into account. The Love numbers are about three times smaller than those for the Earth and are very sensitive to core changes; e.g., a difference of about 30{\%} is found between a model with a liquid core and an otherwise similar model with a solid core. Tidal displacements on Mars are much smaller than on Earth due to the smaller tidal potential, but also due to the smaller reaction of Mars (smaller Love numbers). For both the tidal diplacement and the tidal external potential perturbations, the tidal signal is at the limit of detection and is too small to permit properties of Mars's interior to be inferred. On the other hand, the Phobos tidally induced gravity changes, which are subdiurnal with typical periods shorter than 12 h, can be measured very precisely by the very broad band seismometer with thermal control of the seismological experiment SEIS of the upcoming NetLander mission. It is shown that the Phobos-induced gravity tides could be used to study the Martian core.},

Back to the era of the Viking orbiters, clues accumulated in favor of recent volcanism in relation with ground water release and the formation of long sub-parallel fissures. Four aqueous flood channel systems emanate from linear fissures. Recent eruptions of low viscosity lavas originate from these fissures and from low shield volcanoes. The objective of this paper is to constrain the volcanic history of this region, and to determine the chronological relationships with fluvial/erosional processes. New observations (e.g., new shield volcanoes and one new fluvial event) are summarized on a context map. Thirty-five surfaces have been dated from the count of about 15,000 impact craters. Ages have been cross-checked with relative stratigraphy when possible. A probabilistic approach has been introduced to compare similar ages and define periods of volcanic activity. Our results confirm that some volcanic features are extremely recent (∼2My). Active periods are found at 2.5–3My, 4.3My, 13.5–16.2My, 19My, 21–32My, 58My, 71My, 85–95My, 134My, 173My and 234My, not excluding the possibility that some of the gaps would be filled with additional crater counts. The volcanic activity thus extended for at least the last 250My. The lava volumes have been estimated from the topographic modeling of the floor of depressions filled up by volcanic products, including the volumes of several large crater cavities buried under lavas ({\textgreater}20{\%} of the total volume). Our new estimation of the total lava volume is 1.5±0.2×105km3. This value corresponds to an average thickness of one hundred meters of lavas for the young volcanic plain. As a consequence, the total eruption rate at CEP, defined as the total volume of lava divided by the time of emplacement 1.4×10−2–1.8×10−2m3/s is lower than values typically estimated for terrestrial hot spots or large igneous provinces, suggesting longer inactive periods. The concept of mantle plumes responsible for terrestrial flood volcanism may not be applicable to the case of CEP and the mechanism proposed in Schumacher and Dreuer (2007) offers a plausible alternative to explain our observations.},

abstract = {We use the total mass, possible core radius and the observed mean moment of inertia factor of Mars to constrain mineralogical and compositional structures of Mars. We adopt a liquid Fe–S system for the Martian core and construct density models of the interior of Mars for a series of mantle compositions, core compositions and temperature profiles. The moment of inertia factor of the planet is then calculated and compared to the observation to place constraints on Mars composition. Based on the independent constraints of total mass, possible core radius of 1630–1830km, and the mean moment of inertia factor (0.3645±0.0005) of Mars, we find that Fe content in the Martian mantle is between 9.9 and 11.9mol{\%}, Al content in the Martian mantle smaller than 1.5mol{\%}, S content in the Martian core between 10.6 and 14.9wt{\%}. The inferred Fe content in the bulk Mars lies between 27.3 and 32.0wt{\%}, and the inferred Fe/Si ratio in Mars between 1.55 and 1.95, within a range too broad to make a conclusion whether Mars has the same nonvolatile bulk composition as that of CI chondrite. We also conclude that no perovskite layer exists in the bottom of the Martian mantle. Based on the inferred density models, we estimate the flattening factor and J2 gravitational potential related to the hydrostatic figure of the rotating Mars to be (5.0304±0.0098)×10-3 and (1.8151±0.0065)×10-3, respectively. We also discuss implications of these compositional models to the understanding of formation and evolution of the planet.},

abstract = {Using element correlations observed in SNC meteorites and general cosmochemical constraints, W{\"{a}}nke {\&} Dreibus (1988) have estimated the bulk composition of Mars. The mean abundance value for moderately volatile elements Na, P, K, F, and Rb and most of the volatile elements like Cl, Br, and I in the Martian mantle exceed the terrestrial values by about a factor of two. The striking depletion of all elements with chalcophile character (Cu, Co, Ni, etc.) indicates that Mars, contrary to the Earth, accreted homogeneously, which also explains the obvious low abundance of water and carbon. SNC meteorites and especially the shergottites are very dry rocks, they also contain very little carbon, while the concentrations of chlorine and especially sulphur are higher than those in terrestrial rocks. As a consequence we should expect SO2 and HC1 to be the most abundant compounds in Martian volcanic gases. This might explain the dominance of sulphur and chlorine in the Viking soils. In turn SO2, being an excellent greenhouse gas, may have been of major importance for the warm and wet period in the ancient Martian history. Episodic release of larger quantities of SO2 stored in liquid or solid SO2 tables in the Martian regolith triggered by volcanic intrusions as suggested here could lead to a large number of warm and wet climate periods of the order of a hundred years, interrupted by much longer cold periods characterized by water ice and liquid of solid SO2. Sulphur (FeS) probably also governs the oxygen fugacity of the Martian surface rocks.},

abstract = {The polar caps of Mars have long been acknowledged to be composed of unknown proportions of water ice, solid CO2 (dry ice), and dust. Gravity and topography data are here analyzed over the southern cap to place constraints on its density, and hence composition. Using a localized spectral analysis combined with a lithospheric flexure model of ice cap loading, the best fit density of the volatile-rich south polar layered deposits is found to be 1271 kg m−3 with 1-$\sigma$ limits of 1166 and 1391 kg m−3. The best fit elastic thickness of this geologically young deposit is 140 km, though any value greater than 102 km can fit the observations. The best fit density implies that about 55{\%} dry ice by volume could be sequestered in these deposits if they were completely dust free. Alternatively, if these deposits were completely free of solid CO2, the dust content would be constrained to lie between about 14 and 28{\%} by volume. The bulk thermal conductivity of the polar cap is not significantly affected by these maximum allowable concentrations of dust. However, even if a moderate quantity of solid CO2 were present as horizontal layers, the bulk thermal conductivity of the polar cap would be significantly reduced. Reasonable estimates of the present day heat flow of Mars predict that dry ice beneath the thicker portions of the south polar cap would have melted. Depending on the quantity of solid CO2 in these deposits today, it is even possible that water ice could melt where the cap is thickest. If independent estimates for either the dust or CO2 content of the south polar cap could be obtained, and if radar sounding data could determine whether this polar cap is presently experiencing basal melting or not, it would be possible to use these observations to place tight constraints on the present day heat flow of Mars.},

abstract = {The early history of Mars included two large-scale events of great significance: (1) the lowering and resurfacing of one-third of the crust, followed closely by (2) evolution of the Tharsis bulge. Tharsis development apparently involved two stages: (1) an initial rapid topographic rise accompanied by the development of a vast radial fault system, and (2) an extremely long-lived volcanic stage apparently continuing to the geologic present. A deformational model is proposed whereby a first-order mantle convection cell caused early subcrustal erosion and foundering of the low third of the planet. Underplating and deep intrusion by the eroded materials beneath Tharsis caused isostatic doming. Minor radial gravity motions of surficial layers off the dome produced the radial fault system. The hot underplate eventually affected the surface to cause the very long-lived volcanic second stage. Deep crustal anisotropy associated with the locally NE-trending boundary between the highland two-thirds and the lowland one-third caused the NE elongation of many features of Tharsis.},

However, the origin of the elevated geoid and topography in the Tharsis region remains unresolved between two competing models. In the first model the Tharsis Rise is dynamically supported by a thermal plume in the mantle [Kiefer and Hager, LPI Tech. Rep. 89-04 (1989) 48–50; Harder and Christensen, Nature 380 (1996) 507–509; Breuer et al., J. Geophys. Res. 101 (1996) 7531–7542], while the second model attributes the Tharsis anomalies to volcanic construction and its associated lithospheric flexural effects [Turcotte et al., J. Geophys. Res. 86 (1981) 3951–3959; Phillips et al., Science 291 (2001) 2587–2591]. Here we resolve this ambiguity by modeling the ratio of gravity and topography at long wavelengths with a new loading formulation that simultaneously considers plume buoyancy and surface loads. We demonstrate that a thermal plume contributes no more than 15{\%} to the geoid and 25{\%} to the topography for the Tharsis Rise for the range of lithospheric thicknesses that are constrained by observations. This indicates that the Tharsis Rise is best explained by volcanic construction on lithosphere.},

abstract = {The surface of Mars consists of an old, heavily cratered and elevated southern hemisphere and younger, resurfaced and depressed northern hemisphere, a feature often termed the crustal dichotomy. The global crustal structure [Zuber et al., 2000] revealed by topography and gravity data from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, and the possible late formation of the boundary zone between the hemispheres [McGill and Dimitriou, 1990], have been proposed to indicate an endogenic origin for the dichotomy. However, degree-1 mantle convection that is required for any endogenic process to be viable cannot be produced with conventional mantle convection models [Schubert et al., 1990]. We have studied the role of radially stratified viscosity on mantle deformation by using Rayleigh–Taylor instability analyses in a spherical shell geometry. Our analyses reveal that when mantle viscosity is stratified with a weak asthenosphere, deformation at long wavelengths is more efficient than that at short wavelengths. The weaker the asthenosphere, the longer the wavelength at which the deformation is the most efficient. A thicker asthenosphere also favors the deformation at long wavelengths. Both the Rayleigh–Taylor instability analyses and numerical modeling of mantle convection show that degree-1 convection can be produced within the Martian mantle provided that the mantle had a weak asthenosphere (∼500 km thick and ∼102 times weaker than the underlying mantle) early in planetary history. The degree-1 convection causes preferential heating of one hemisphere that may explain the primary features associated with the dichotomy in crustal structure.},

@article{Hood2003,
abstract = {Crustal magnetic fields on Mars are inhomogeneously distributed with the strongest fields occurring over the southern highlands in a longitude sector between approximately 130degreesE and 240degreesE. Using analytic approximations and empirical scaling laws, it is estimated that much of the weakly magnetized southern highlands (i.e., that between 110degreesW and 130degreesE) was shocked to pressures exceeding 1-2 GPa during the Hellas and Argyre impacts. Possible primary remanence carriers in the martian crust include iron oxides and iron sulfides (pyrrhotite). If pyrrhotite is the main remanence carrier, extensive demagnetization of crustal regions (similar to90{\%}) may occur at shock pressures of 2 GPa or more. Thus, at least for this remanence carrier, impact shock demagnetization can potentially explain the distribution of crustal fields in the southern highlands.},

Within this area, 16 prospective ellipses were identified, which lie ∼600 km north of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. Mapping of terrains in rapidly acquired CTX images identified especially benign smooth terrain and led to the downselection to four northern ellipses. Acquisition of nearly continuous HiRISE, additional Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), and High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images, along with radar data confirmed that ellipse E9 met all landing site constraints: with slopes {\textless}15{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} at 84 m and 2 m length scales for radar tracking and touchdown stability, low rock abundance ({\textless}10 {\%}) to avoid impact and spacecraft tip over, instrument deployment constraints, which included identical slope and rock abundance constraints, a radar reflective and load bearing surface, and a fragmented regolith ∼5 m thick for full penetration of the heat flow probe.

abstract = {Although not the prime focus of the InSight mission, the near-surface geology and physical properties investigations provide critical information for both placing the instruments (seismometer and heat flow probe with mole) on the surface and for understanding the nature of the shallow subsurface and its effect on recorded seismic waves. Two color cameras on the lander will obtain multiple stereo images of the surface and its interaction with the spacecraft. Images will be used to identify the geologic materials and features present, quantify their areal coverage, help determine the basic geologic evolution of the area, and provide ground truth for orbital remote sensing data. A radiometer will measure the hourly temperature of the surface in two spots, which will determine the thermal inertia of the surface materials present and their particle size and/or cohesion. Continuous measurements of wind speed and direction offer a unique opportunity to correlate dust devils and high winds with eolian changes imaged at the surface and to determine the threshold friction wind stress for grain motion on Mars. During the first two weeks after landing, these investigations will support the selection of instrument placement locations that are relatively smooth, flat, free of small rocks and load bearing. Soil mechanics parameters and elastic properties of near surface materials will be determined from mole penetration and thermal conductivity measurements from the surface to 3--5 m depth, the measurement of seismic waves during mole hammering, passive monitoring of seismic waves, and experiments with the arm and scoop of the lander (indentations, scraping and trenching). These investigations will determine and test the presence and mechanical properties of the expected 3--17 m thick fragmented regolith (and underlying fractured material) built up by impact and eolian processes on top of Hesperian lava flows and determine its seismic properties for the seismic investigation of Mars' interior.},

abstract = {Using topography and gravity data as constraints, we formulate spherical harmonic thin elastic-shell models to determine the subsurface structure of the Hellas and Utopia basins. For Hellas, we show that our model is consistent with the elastic thickness results of McGovern et al. (2002, 2004). The thin elastic lithosphere at the time of formation implies that Hellas is close to isostatic. Since Utopia formed earlier, we argue that an isostatic assumption is justified for the Utopia basin before it was filled. From this supposition, we derive a system of equations that allows us to solve for the amount of fill, the prefill topography, and the amount of flexure due to the fill within the Utopia basin. An analysis of the parameter space shows that the fill density and the amount of fill is strongly dependent on the elastic thickness at the time of infilling. A thinner elastic lithosphere favors a denser fill, while a thicker lithosphere will allow for less dense material. Likewise, larger crustal thickness values lead to smaller fill density values. The presence of quasi-circular depressions, interpreted as impact craters, within the Utopia basin indicates that the majority of the material within Utopia was deposited prior to 4.04–4.11 Ga. The early timing for the deposition combined with the heat imparted by the basin forming event argues for a thinner lithosphere which could, in turn, suggest fill densities that are more consistent with a volcanic load than with pure sediment or ice-rich material. These results are supported using an alternative method of determining the amount of fill and flexure within Utopia. This model assumes that Hellas and Utopia were initially identical and that the only difference in their subsequent evolution was the addition of material in the Utopia basin. The volume of material needed to fill Utopia is immense (on the order of 50 million km3 or more). The high density obtained for the fill requires that it contain a large igneous component, the source of which is problematic. Relaxing the isostatic assumption to a reasonable degree perturbs the density bound only slightly.},

abstract = {We present a theory for the computation of phase equilibria and physical properties of multicomponent assemblages relevant to the mantle of the Earth. The theory differs from previous treatments in being thermodynamically self-consistent: the theory is based on the concept of fundamental thermodynamic relations appropriately generalized to anisotropic strain and in encompassing elasticity in addition to the usual isotropic thermodynamic properties. In this first paper, we present the development of the theory, discuss its scope, and focus on its application to physical properties of mantle phases at elevated pressure and temperature including the equation of state, thermochernical properties and the elastic wave velocities. We find that the Eulerian finite strain formulation captures the variation of the elastic moduli with compression. The variation of the vibrational frequencies with compression is also cast as a Taylor series expansion in the Eulerian finite strain, the appropriate volume derivative of which leads to an expression for the Gruneisen parameter that agrees well with results from first principles theory. For isotropic materials, the theory contains nine material-specific parameters: the values at ambient conditions of the Helmholtz free energy, volume, bulk and shear moduli, their pressure derivatives, an effective Debye temperature, its first and second logarithmic volume derivatives (gamma(o), q(0)), and the shear strain derivative of gamma. We present and discuss in some detail the results of a global inversion of a wide variety of experimental data and first principles theoretical results, supplemented by systematic relations, for the values of these parametersfor 31 mantle species. Among our findings is that the value of q is likely to be significantly greater than unity for most mantle species. We apply the theory to the computation of the shear wave velocity, and temperature and compositional (Fe content) derivatives at relevant mantle pressure temperature conditions. Among the patterns that emerge is that garnet is anomalous in being remarkably insensitive to iron content or temperature as compared with other mantle phases.},

abstract = {Empirical finite strain theories, currently favored by various authors for geophysical use, are critically reexamined. We focus attention on higher derivatives, especially K′ = dK/dP (P is pressure and K is bulk modulus), which discriminate more sharply between alternative equations than do P(V) relationships. A thermodynamic analysis of the infinite pressure extrapolation is presented more rigorously than hitherto, confirming several crucial constraints: adiabatic and isothermal moduli, KSand KT, become equal, K′∞has a limited admissible range and is an unambiguous parameter, applying to adiabats and isotherms at any temperature. At P→∞ Slater's formula for the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter, $\gamma$=K′/2-1/6, assumes the status of an identity and q=(∂ln$\gamma$/∂ln V)T→0. There is a strong advantage to using an equation relating K′ to P/K, making use of the condition K′∞=(P/K)∞-1and avoiding difficulties with the commonly used Birch, logarithmic and Rydberg equations. On the P/K scale the infinite pressure asymptote is as close as the zero pressure limit for the lower mantle and much closer in case of the core, making it a powerful constraint. Equations of state for the lower mantle and core are developed using the PREM tabulations as starting models. For the lower mantle thermodynamic relationships link finite strain equations to thermal properties, permitting an assessment of the thermal contribution to tomographically observed seismic velocity anomalies. As we demonstrate by comparing the laboratory compression of iron with core data, Earth models offer much more effective tests of high pressure equations of state than do laboratory data and can be used to recalibrate laboratory pressure scales. A recalibration of the platinum pressure scale is presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examine the problem of obtaining the thermal structure and bulk chemical composition of the lower mantle from its seismologically determined velocity and density profiles, and the most recent results on the elastic properties of the relevant phases (including, of particular importance, shear moduli). A novel aspect of this paper is the application of an iterative technique solving generalized non-linear inverse problem, which allows us to simultaneously consider a complex chemical system (the MgO-FeO-SiO2-Al2O3-CaO system, which includes all major components in the lower mantle), and to rigorously evaluate the full covariance and resolution matrices. The effects of experimental uncertainties in the shear moduli are carefully accounted for. We show that although the a posteriori uncertainties in the results for lower-mantle compositions are relatively large, the averaged lower-mantle Mg/Si ratio should be lower than 1.3 in order to satisfactorily fit the 1-D seismic profiles. Two distinct families of best-fitting models are determined. The first is based upon a value for the pressure derivative of the perovskite shear modulus that is representative of various existing experimental measurements ($\mu$'0 = 1.8). Under this assumption, it is not possible to match the lower mantle seismic properties with an adiabatic geotherm and uniform chemical composition. Instead, this family of solutions is characterized by a geotherm with large temperature gradients (dT/dz increases from 0.5 to 0.9 Kkm-1 between 800 and 2700 km and the temperature reaches 3400 K at the depth of 2700 km), and a depth dependent bulk composition with an Mg/Si ratio decreasing from 1.18 +/- 0.14 to 1.03 +/- 0.16 between 800 and 2700 km. The second family of solutions is obtained when we attempt to fit the lower mantle with a simpler compositional and thermal structure. This can only be done when the pressure derivative of the shear modulus for perovskite is close to the most recent values obtained by Brillouin spectroscopy, that is, with a $\mu$'0 close to 1.6 instead of 1.8. The resulting temperature gradient is 0.25 Kkm-1 in the upper part of the lower mantle and 0.5 Kkm-1 below 1700 km depth; the geotherm reaches 2800 K at a depth of 2700 km. Corresponding Mg/Si ratio remains rather constant and close to 1.16 throughout the lower mantle. We show that the temperature gradient is strongly correlated with the pressure derivative $\mu$'0 of the shear modulus of perovskite: lower values of $\mu$'0 imply lower thermal gradients. We also discuss the importance of the Bullen parameter as an additional constraint. In order to refine conclusions on the lower-mantle structure, additional independent observables, such as accurate observations on electrical conductivity and 1-D Q profiles, are necessary.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of 254 end-members, including 210 mineral end-members, 18 silicate liquid end-members and 26 aqueous fluid species are presented in a revised and updated internally consistent thermodynamic data set. The PVT properties of the data set phases are now based on a modified Tait equation of state (EOS) for the solids and the Pitzer {\&} Sterner (1995) equation for gaseous components. Thermal expansion and compressibility are linked within the modified Tait EOS (TEOS) by a thermal pressure formulation using an Einstein temperature to model the temperature dependence of both the thermal expansion and bulk modulus in a consistent way. The new EOS has led to improved fitting of the phase equilibrium experiments. Many new end-members have been added, including several deep mantle phases and, for the first time, sulphur-bearing minerals. Silicate liquid end-members are in good agreement with both phase equilibrium experiments and measured heat of melting. The new dataset considerably enhances the capabilities for thermodynamic calculation on rocks, melts and aqueous fluids under crustal to deep mantle conditions. Implementations are already available in thermocalc to take advantage of the new data set and its methodologies, as illustrated by example calculations on sapphirine-bearing equilibria, sulphur-bearing equilibria and calculations to 300kbar and 2000C to extend to lower mantle conditions. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Comparison of seismic velocities in mantle minerals, under mantle conditions, with seismic data is a first step toward constraining mantle chemistry. The calculation, however, is uncertain due to lack of data on certain physical properties. "Global" systematics have not proved very useful in estimating these properties, particularly for the shear parameters. A new approach to elasticity estimation is used in this study to produce estimates of unknown quantities, primarily pressure and temperature derivatives of elastic moduli, from the structural and chemical trends evident in the large amount of elasticity data now available. These trends suggest that the derivatives of unmeasured high-pressure phases can be estimated from "analogous" low-pressure phases. Us- ing these predictions and the best available measurements, seismic velocities are computed along high-temperature ariabats for a set of mantle minerals using third-order finite strain theory. The calculation of density and moduli at high temperature, to initiate the ariabat, must be done with care since parameters such as thermal expansion are not independent of temperature. Both com- pressional and shear seismic profiles are well-matched by a mineralogy dominated by clinopyroxene and garnet and with an elivine content of approximately 40{\%} by volume. Between 670 and 1000 km, perovskite alone provides a good fit to the seismic velocities. Combining seismic velocities with recent phase equilibria data for a hypothetical pure elivine mantle suggests that a mineralogy with a maximum of 35{\%} elivine {\{}shear profile) or 40-53{\%} elivine {\{}compressional profile) by volume can satisfy the constraint imposed by the 400-km discontinuity. Other features of the upper mantle can then be matched by appropriate combinations of pyroxenes, garnets, and their high-pressure equivalents. While mantle models with a substantially larger fraction of elivine cannot be ruled out, they are acceptable only if the derivatives of the spinel phases are substantially different from elivine and deviate from trends in the larger data set.}}},

abstract = {The temperature and pressure derivatives of the elastic moduli M of solids can be cast into the form of dimensionless logarithmic anharmonic {\{}DLA{\}} parameters, ∂ ln M/∂ In p = {\{}M{\}} at constant temperature, pressure, or entropy (T, P, S), where p is the density. These parameters show little variation from material to material and are expected to show little variation with temperature at high temperature. Most of the available derivative data for ionic solids has been renormalized and analyzed for dependency on ion type, crystal structure, and other parameters. The {\{}DLA{\}} parameters exhibit little variation and little correlation with crystal structure for most close-packed halides and oxides. There are small systematic variations with ionic radius, Gruneisen's $\gamma$, and the bulk modulus-rigidity ratio (K/G). Temperature and pressure derivatives are correlated because of the importance of the volume-dependent, or extrinsic, terms. The intrinsic terms {\{}K{\}}v and {\{}G{\}}v are also highly correlated, even for open-packed structures, where ∂ ln M/$\alpha$∂T = {\{}M{\}}v. These correlations make it possible to estimate the derivatives of high-pressure phases. The spinel forms of olivine are predicted to have “normal” derivatives, and therefore the magnitude of the modulus or velocity jump associated with the olivine-spinel transition near 400 km should be similar to that measured in the laboratory. The actual size of the 400-km discontinuity is much less, indicating the presence of substantial quantities of minerals other than olivine in the upper mantle or transition region. Recent calculations in apparent support of a homogeneous olivine-rich ({\textgreater}60{\%}) mantle are based on choices for the derivatives of $\beta$- and $\gamma$-Mg2SiO4, which are unlike other ionic crystals. There is no evidence that these phases should be anomalous in their physical properties. The temperature and pressure derivatives of ionic crystals depend on the nature of the ions and their coordination.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a new method and implementation (Instaseis) to store global Green's functions in a database which allows for near-instantaneous (on the order of milliseconds) extraction of arbitrary seismograms. Using the axisymmetric spectral element method (AxiSEM), the generation of these databases, based on reciprocity of the Green's functions, is very efficient and is approximately half as expensive as a single AxiSEM forward run. Thus, this enables the computation of full databases at half the cost of the computation of seismograms for a single source in the previous scheme and allows to compute databases at the highest frequencies globally observed. By storing the basis coefficients of the numerical scheme (Lagrange polynomials), the Green's functions are 4th order accurate in space and the spatial discretization respects discontinuities in the velocity model exactly. High-order temporal interpolation using Lanczos resampling allows to retrieve seismograms at any sampling rate. AxiSEM is easily adaptable to arbitrary spherically symmetric models of Earth as well as other planets. In this paper, we present the basic rationale and details of the method as well as benchmarks and illustrate a variety of applications.

abstract = {Using topography and gravity data as constraints, we formulate spherical harmonic thin elastic-shell models to determine the subsurface structure of the Hellas and Utopia basins. For Hellas, we show that our model is consistent with the elastic thickness results of McGovern et al. (2002, 2004). The thin elastic lithosphere at the time of formation implies that Hellas is close to isostatic. Since Utopia formed earlier, we argue that an isostatic assumption is justified for the Utopia basin before it was filled. From this supposition, we derive a system of equations that allows us to solve for the amount of fill, the prefill topography, and the amount of flexure due to the fill within the Utopia basin. An analysis of the parameter space shows that the fill density and the amount of fill is strongly dependent on the elastic thickness at the time of infilling. A thinner elastic lithosphere favors a denser fill, while a thicker lithosphere will allow for less dense material. Likewise, larger crustal thickness values lead to smaller fill density values. The presence of quasi-circular depressions, interpreted as impact craters, within the Utopia basin indicates that the majority of the material within Utopia was deposited prior to 4.04–4.11 Ga. The early timing for the deposition combined with the heat imparted by the basin forming event argues for a thinner lithosphere which could, in turn, suggest fill densities that are more consistent with a volcanic load than with pure sediment or ice-rich material. These results are supported using an alternative method of determining the amount of fill and flexure within Utopia. This model assumes that Hellas and Utopia were initially identical and that the only difference in their subsequent evolution was the addition of material in the Utopia basin. The volume of material needed to fill Utopia is immense (on the order of 50 million km3 or more). The high density obtained for the fill requires that it contain a large igneous component, the source of which is problematic. Relaxing the isostatic assumption to a reasonable degree perturbs the density bound only slightly.},

abstract = {In order to differentiate between boulder avalanche deposits triggered by temperature/climate controlled melting of ice or triggered by ground shaking produced by paleomarsquakes, spatial variation in boulder size populations has been measured from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images along Cerberus Fossae, one of the youngest fracture/graben systems on the Martian surface. The boulders have fallen from less than ∼500 m high fault-controlled cliffs and rolled and bounced across relatively coarse-grained sediment, forming colluvial fans. The boulders have left trails in the dust in some cases, coming to rest on relatively fine-grained Aeolian sediment. The boulder size distribution varies along the graben contrary to what would be expected if boulder falls had been liberated by temperature/climate controlled melting of ice. Boulder size and boulder trail data peak close to the center of the fault system, decreasing along strike. Furthermore, evidence for relatively recent surface faulting of colluvial slopes along the fault-controlled cliffs is confined to the area with anomalously large boulder/trail size data. We interpret the above as consistent with observations of terrestrial earthquake-triggered boulder avalanches where boulder sizes decrease away from the epicenter and surface faulting. We discuss the implications of possible marsquakes along Cerberus Fossae in terms of active faulting associated with dike emplacement that is subradial to the Elysium Mons volcano.},

abstract = {The 2016 NASA InSight lander is the first planetary mission designed to study the deep interior of Mars. InSight's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) package will quantify global and regional seismic activity and determine parameters like core properties, mantle composition, and Martian lithospheric thickness. An improved understanding of the location, magnitude, and frequency of potential seismic sources is essential for optimization of instrument design, sampling strategy, and interpretation of mission data. We focus on forecasting seismic activity for the Cerberus Fossae of the Elysium Planitia, chosen for their proximity to the proposed landing site and their recent formation and assuming these are active tectonic grabens. The minimum age we determine for the units around the Fossae, using Context Camera and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment imagery for crater density surveying, is 10 Ma, placing them in the Late Amazonian. We are able to determine the rate of motion from measurements of observed throw, assuming that the faults remain active. Digital terrain models, made from stereo-image pairs from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), are used to determine the maximum throw on four graben systems. Using these measured throws to estimate a length-averaged slip and assuming an inferred slip rate from surface age, we estimate an annual moment release of . From this we calculate an annual size-frequency distribution of events using the G{\"{u}}tenberg-Richter relationship. We estimate that between 1.5×100and 1.9×105events per year will have an amplitude greater than the peak band noise and so will be detectable at the InSight landing site.},

abstract = {The geomorphology and topography of the Cerberus Plains region of Mars show three spatially and temporally distinct, young, aqueous flood channel systems. Flood geomorphology in each of these channels, as seen in Mars Orbiter Camera images, consists of streamlined forms, longitudinal lineations, and a single occurrence of transverse dunes, features similar to those in the flood-carved terrain of the Channeled Scabland in the northwestern United States. As additional geomorphic evidence of flooding, small cones (interpreted as phreatic) are found preferentially in the channels or at their distal ends. Glaciers, lava flows, and CO2-charged density flows are each inconsistent with these geomorphic features. Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data show two of the three channel systems (Athabasca Valles and an unnamed northern channel system) emanating from the Cerberus Fossae; we suggest that the third channel system (Marte Vallis) also originated at the fissures. The discharges for two of the three systems (Athabasca Valles and Marte Vallis) have been estimated from surface topography to have been on the order of 106m3/s. Crater counts indicate that the channels are not only young (extreme Late Amazonian), but also were carved asynchronously. Geomorphic evidence suggests that two of the channels (Athabasca and Marte Valles) experienced more than one flood. Emanation from volcanotectonic fissures instead of chaotic terrain distinguishes these Cerberus Plains channels from the larger, older circum-Chryse channels. Groundwater must have collected in a liquid state prior to flood onset to flow at the estimated discharge rates. Lack of large-scale subsidence near the channels' origination points along the Cerberus Fossae indicates that this groundwater was at least several kilometers deep. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

On the basis of a conversion to model absolute ages, this chronology extends back hundreds of millions of years into a previously unknown “pre-Noachian” epoch during which a now buried highlands surface was established, in which several very large impact basins formed while the global magnetic field was still present. A cluster of very large “lowland-making” basins occurred at a model age of about 4.13 GY (or earlier), forming the fundamental topography of the Mars crustal dichotomy at a time prior to the age of the oldest visible highland crust. This early event in Martian history marks the transition from the “pre-Noachian” to the Early Noachian when the well-preserved Hellas, Argyre, and Isidis basins formed, all after the global magnetic field died.},

abstract = {? Abstract? The bulk of the ?50-km-thick Martian crust formed at ?4.5 Gyr B.P., perhaps from a magma ocean. This crust is probably a basaltic andesite or andesite and is enriched in incompatible and heat-producing elements. Later additions of denser basalt to the crust were volumetrically minor, but resurfaced significant portions of the Northern hemisphere. A significant fraction of the total thickness of the crust was magnetized prior to 4 Gyr B.P., with the magnetization later selectively removed by large impacts. Early large impacts also modified the hemispheric contrast in crustal thickness (the dichotomy), which was possibly caused by long-wavelength mantle convection. Subsequent Noachian modification of the crust included further impacts, significant fluvial erosion, and volcanism associated with the formation of the Tharsis rise. Remaining outstanding questions include the origin of the dichotomy and the nature of the magnetic anomalies.},

In turn, these crater count values are converted to model-absolute ages based on the inferred cratering rate histories. We present a new boundary definition for the Late Hesperian-Early Amazonian transition. Our fitting of crater size-frequency distributions to the chronostratigraphic record of Mars permits the assignment of cumulative counts of craters down to 100. m, 1. km, 2. km, 5. km, and 16. km diameters to martian epochs. Due to differences in the " standard" crater size-frequency production distributions, a generalized crater-density-based definition to the chronostratigraphic system cannot be provided. For the diameter range used for the boundary definitions, the resulting model absolute age fits vary within 1.5{\%} for a given set of production function and chronology model ages. Crater distributions translated to absolute ages utilizing different curve descriptions can result in absolute age differences exceeding 10{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Tharsis Rise is an area of extensive volcanism containing the most significant long-wavelength topographic and areoid anomalies on Mars. The mechanism for supporting this large topographic expression and correlating areoid remains controversial. The two main competing ideas are dynamic support by a deep, mantle plume and a volcanically constructed lithosphere followed by lithospheric flexure. While both of these models, separately, can account for specific features of Tharsis, neither explain its entirety. Most of the support of the Tharsis topographic anomaly is best explained by a volcanic structure modifying the lithosphere. However, this raises the important question of the origin of the heat source for volcanic construction, leading to possible small-scale convection. This demonstrates that the remaining topography and areoid not accounted for in lower end-members of volcanically constructed surface loads is consistent with a deeper, mantle plume source. Our results show we can produce about 15{\%} and 18{\%} of the total Tharsis long-wavelength areoid and topography anomaly with a plume forming in a strong, temperature-dependent rheology. Additionally, our plume model has a 165 km thick rheological lithosphere (within the range for present-day estimates on Mars) and generates about 1{\%} partial melting, more than sufficient to provide a heat source for recent volcanism. This implies both a model with dynamic support from a plume and a volcanically constructed lithosphere not only can coexist but offer an explanation for both the surface anomalies and heat needed for the minor amount of recent volcanic activity at Tharsis Rise.

abstract = {A new model for the origin and evolution of the Tharsis province that emphasizes that the topography of Tharsis may be produced largely by construction, rather than uplift, is proposed. Underlying the model is the premise that the elastic lithosphere of Mars was laterally heterogeneous early in Martian history; such heterogeneity is discernible later in Martian history from the variable tectonic response of the lithosphere to local surface loads. It is contended that the mechanism for the evolution of Tharsis described here led to permanent topographic and gravity highs and a greatly thickened crust in the Tharsis region. An important advantage of the model is that no anomalous dynamical or chemical properties need be sustained in the Martian mantle beneath Tharsis for billions of years. The mantle beneath Tharsis is thus seen as playing a passive rather than an active role in the regional volcanic and tectonic activity, much like the role of the mantle beneath major midocean ridges on earth.},

From 10 cases with different Rayleigh number, activation energy, and activation volume, we determined T-e ranging from 100 km to 180 km and D-p that is approximately twice T-e.
